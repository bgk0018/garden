# Vital Question 3

What actions are you taking?

Are you merely [[zettelkasten/Reaction - 202304261216\|reacting]] to the [[zettelkasten/Problem - 202304261228\|Problems]] of the moment, or are you taking creative and generative action, including the solving of problems, in service to outcomes?[^1]

>Question 1. Where are you putting your focus? Are you focusing on problems or on outcomes? Question 2. How are you relating? How are you relating to others, to your experience, and even to yourself? Are you relating in ways that produce or perpetuate drama, or in ways that empower others and yourself to be more resourceful, resilient, and innovative? Question 3. What actions are you taking? Are you merely reacting to the problems of the moment, or are you taking creative and generative action—including the solving of problems—in service to outcomes?
