# Vital Question 2

How are you relating?

How are you relating to others, to your experience and yourself? Are you relating in ways that produce or perpetuate drama, or in ways that empower others and yourself to be more resourceful, resilient and innovative?[^1]

There are several layers to this question:[^2]

- How are you relating to other people?
- How are you relating to what is going on in your life?
- How are you relating to yourself?

>Question 1. Where are you putting your focus? Are you focusing on problems or on outcomes? Question 2. How are you relating? How are you relating to others, to your experience, and even to yourself? Are you relating in ways that produce or perpetuate drama, or in ways that empower others and yourself to be more resourceful, resilient, and innovative? Question 3. What actions are you taking? Are you merely reacting to the problems of the moment, or are you taking creative and generative action—including the solving of problems—in service to outcomes?
