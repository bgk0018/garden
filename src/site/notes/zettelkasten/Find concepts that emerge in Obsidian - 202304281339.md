# Content

A couple of ways to look for emergent ideas are:

## Basic Search

- Ctrl + O Open command that includes referenced but not created notes
- Ctrl + Shift + F Search and searching for a word, this will include all mentions even in the body of the note 

## Lightning Rods of Thought

A collection of dataview queries that show those notes that have the most outgoing, incoming, orphans, and embedded search for keyword.

- Outgoing heavy linking notes are probably a good candidate for a [[Map of Content\|Map of Content]].
- Incoming heavy linking notes are probably a good candidate for fleshing out the note more so that it can elevate to a [[Map of Content\|Map of Content]].
- Embedded search for a keyword are tracking a specific relationship you think will likely have interesting outcomes, these will be specific to the topics you take notes on
- Orphans are notes that are good candidates for deleting or otherwise evolving their relationship within your vault.

## Excalibrain

- Using the graph view of excalibrain and the metadata set on your notes to see graphically the relationships between your notes.
