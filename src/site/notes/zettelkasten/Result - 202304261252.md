>“As you focus on your envisioned outcome, your passion goes up.” He drew a plus sign. “As your passion increases, your desire to take the next baby step increases, too.” Another plus sign. “Then, as you take that next step, you get closer to, or clearer about, the outcome”—a third plus sign on the board—“and that increases your passion and your will to take action.” ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=516)) #✂️
