- [[zettelkasten/Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory - 202305072151\|Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Theory]], developed by [[references/Geert Hofstede\|Geert Hofstede]], is a framework used to understand the differences in culture across countries.
- Hofstede’s initial six key dimensions include [[Power Distance\|Power Distance]], [[Uncertainty Avoidance\|Uncertainty Avoidance]], [[Individualism-Collectivism\|Individualism-Collectivism]], [[Masculinity-Femininity\|Masculinity-Femininity]], and [[Short vs Long-Term Orientation\|Short vs Long-Term Orientation]]. Later researchers added [[Restraint vs Indulgence\|Restraint vs Indulgence]] to this list.
- The extent to which individual countries share key dimensions depends on a number of factors, such as shared language and geographical location.
- Hofstede’s cultural dimensions are widely used to understand etiquette and facilitate communication across cultures, in areas ranging from business to diplomacy.
