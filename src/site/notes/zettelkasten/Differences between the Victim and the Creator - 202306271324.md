# Content

A [[zettelkasten/Creator - 202306271318\|Creator]] chooses how to [[zettelkasten/Reaction - 202304261216\|react]], a [[zettelkasten/Victim - 202305251726\|Victim]] does not.[^1]

There's space between what we experience and how we respond and we can control our attitude in that time.[^2]

>“Wait a minute. Are you saying that a Creator chooses a fight, flight, freeze, or appease reaction to whatever is going on? Isn’t that what Victims do?” “You’re so right,” Ted said. “The choosing is the big difference here, as well as the range of choices. There is actually a big difference between just reacting to a situation and choosing how to respond to it.” ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=932)) #✂️

>“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=942)) #✂️
