>Box Seats and Nosebleeds: A Conversation Before the Podcast
>Key takeaways:
>- The speakers enjoyed their seats at a sports stadium.
>- The view from the nosebleed seats wasn't as bad as expected.
>- Nosebleeds occurred due to altitude and cheer excitement.
>- The podcast topic is about shedding cells and its relation to self identity.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 2
>But you had box seats because you're special. They were free. I hope mine were free too.
>Speaker 1
>And the nose pleats. Yeah. I like just about every seat in that place. Yeah.
>Speaker 2
>It's not too bad. I was laughing about the nosebleeds going in.
>Speaker 1
>But then I got up there. I was like, this is great. Yeah. You can see everything. Did your nose actually bleed?
>Speaker 2
>Just twice. Yeah. Once out of a cheer excitement. Right. And then once from the altitude.
>Speaker 1
>And that was more of a spray.
>Speaker 2
>Yeah. Just covering everyone. Yeah. It was like, go Hawks. Boy, what a weird intro. It's a little weird.
>Speaker 1
>But, I mean, it kind of jibs a little bit. Oh, yeah. Because we're talking, yeah. You're mentioning blood. Sure. I was shedding cells and blood. You were. Like blood is made up of cells and we shed tons of cells. But before we get to that, right, there's the fact of the podcast. You shed cells. I want to mention this one thing I read. Yeah. It's called, I think the title of the article is The Self is Moral. It's about like where we get our identity of self from. Like where it's rooted. It was written by a person named Nina Stromire, I believe, is on Aeon magazine. Yeah. Just type in The Self is Moral Aeon. It'll come up. That'll get you there.
