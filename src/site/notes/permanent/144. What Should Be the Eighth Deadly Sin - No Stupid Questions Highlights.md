>The Rise of Perfectionism: A Subjective Search for the Eighth Sin
>Key takeaways:
>- The speaker and the listener are trying to pick the best eighth sin, which is a subjective vote
>- Perfectionism is on the rise among young people in the US
>- Recent research suggests that this trend may be influenced by parents' expectations
>Transcript:
>Speaker 1
>Well, gosh, how do you separate the one from? I mean, this is a pretty subjective vote, really.
>Speaker 2
>But no. Yeah, no, but I'm not just saying that like, oh, I want this to be the sin because like, I struggle. No, this is not where you lie correct.
>Speaker 1
>This is you and I acting on behalf of humankind in order to pick the best eighth sin. So I want you to and I'll do the same.
>Speaker 2
>Wait, before you rate perfectionism and Adam's email is pretty compelling. Maybe my personal story was kind of compelling too, but there are some data. You were selling perfectionism pretty hard. I was and maybe this will sell it more. Perfectionism is on the rise, at least in US samples and particularly with young people. And what the data suggests is that the new generation of young people have more of this perfectionist tendency than say our generation, Stephen, honestly, notwithstanding my little story. So you're saying you're old school by being perfectionist before it was cool? I guess. Maybe I was an early adopter, perfectionism. And then also, there's some recent research on how this may be driven by parents' expectations that parents may be increasingly critical about their kids varying from the perfect report card and the perfect set of extracurriculars and so forth.
>Speaker 1
>I love that the research finds that even though the latest generation of let's say high school students are most at fault, that really who's at fault is the earlier generation. It's the parents. ([Time 0:04:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2ca4dfdc-261a-48ba-9a5c-77400fffc106)) #✂️

>The Eighth Deadly Sin: Disrespect
>Key takeaways:
>- Disrespect is the eighth deadly sin nominated by several individuals including Brad Webb and Zolt Ziget Vary.
>- Social media allows people to criticize others endlessly and often lacks genuine happiness for others.
>- Respect is considered an important dimension in parenting research alongside warmth and appropriate challenge.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 1
>This suggestion is from, oh boy, from several people. There's a Brad Webb, there's a Zolt Ziget Vary and I think a few others and the sin that they are nominating is disrespect. Here's some Brad. My suggestion for the eighth deadly sin is respect or the lack there of today's society has very little self-respect or respect for others. The basic definition is do regard for the feelings, wishes, rights or traditions of others. Social media, Brad rights, has allowed today's society to sit behind their keyboards and criticize others endlessly. Moreover, rarely are people genuinely happy for one another. Typically, they are jealous or envious, which is already, as you know, it's one of the seven deadly sins. What do you think of disrespect, Angela?
>Speaker 2
>What's interesting is that respect is in parenting research. It's one of three dimensions where, like, it's good. The three things that parents should strive to have in terms of how they raise their kids. One, the most obvious one is being warm. Your kid should feel loved, cared about. Another is that you are appropriately demanding. You're supposed to challenge your kids, right? That's part of parenting. The third one is respect. This idea is really not about loving them. It's not even about liking someone. Of course, we are here talking about respect for all people, I assume, not just your children. But I think it's important to say, I think this is about just feeling the other person's perspective, their opinions, who they are.
