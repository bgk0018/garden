# AI Prompt Engineering Is Dead

![cover|150](https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/man-in-blue-shirt-and-briefcase-walking-away-from-camera-in-a-environment-with-lines-and-circles-connected-together-to-look-like.jpg?id=51643003&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C375%2C0%2C375)
## Metadata
- Document Note: New research suggests that prompt engineering, which involves finding a way to phrase a query to an LLM or AI art or video generator to get the best results, is best done by the model itself rather than by a human engineer. This has led to doubts about the future of prompt engineering and suspicions that the jobs may be a passing fad. Autotuned prompts are successful and strange and can be used for image generation algorithms as well. However, prompt engineering jobs in some form are not going away, and the nature of the job will continue evolving quickly.

>Lal’s team created a tool called [NeuroPrompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12229) that takes a simple input prompt, such as ‘boy on a horse’, and automatically enhances it to produce a better picture. To do this, they started with a range of prompts generated by human prompt engineering experts. They then trained a language model to transform simple prompts into these expert-level prompts. On top of that, they used reinforcement learning to optimize these prompts to create more aesthetically pleasing images, as rated by yet another machine learning model, [PickScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01569), a recently developed image evaluation tool.

>Whether the job titles will be “prompt engineer,” “LLMOps engineer,” or something new entirely, the nature of the job will continue evolving quickly. “Maybe we’re calling them prompt engineers today,” Lal says, “But I think the nature of that interaction will just keep on changing as AI models also keep changing.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrhrtfdqm7ncwcmsknde8esy)) #✂️ #👻 ai highlighted
