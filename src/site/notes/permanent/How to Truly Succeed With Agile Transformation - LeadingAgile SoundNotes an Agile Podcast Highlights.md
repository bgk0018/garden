>How to Deal With Dependencies in Early Stage Transformation
>Summary:
>When I have dependencies, when I'm coupled to other things, that reduces my agility. So anytime there's a dependency, it's going to reduce agility. As I reduce batch, I can bring in more opportunities to that feedback. But I still have to deal with the Dependencies. It's only once I break thedependents, can we have a real conversation about doing agile at the team level or agile atScale.

>Going to dinner with 10 other people that collaboration is, it's a lot, right? Because I got to get a hunt. I got to get 10 people's schedules changed, right? Yeah. And then the joke that I make is that when I go to dinner with my in-laws, that's like a firm dependency that can never be broken because it's always 430, it's always a stake. It's always, you know, because they're 83 and so. So more funny when I tell it for real on stage, I think, right? At least people chuckle and give me a humor laugh. But the idea is, is that I'm not in jail bed. When I have dependencies, when I'm coupled to other things, that reduces my agility because I can't deploy, I can't change direction, I can't take unilateral feedback from a client, I can't, just a lot of things I can't do. So anytime there's a dependency, it's going to reduce agility. So in early stage transformation, in the presence of dependencies is team-based, it's agile, it's incremental, it's iterative. I can use Kanban, I can use Scrum, I can do a lot of different things, right? But it's still largely plan driven because those dependencies have to be pretty tightly orchestrated. As I reduce batch, I can bring in more opportunities to that feedback. But I still have to deal with the dependencies. It's only once I break the dependencies, can we have a real conversation about doing agile at the team level or agile at ([Time 0:22:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2ca100bc-2ff4-447d-9604-61091905ac7d)) #✂️

>The Importance of Managing Dependencies
>Summary:
>"Over a three-month period, Martin broke me down to nothing. We isolated what the problems were that were causing me not to be able to squat," he says. "After about three months, I could do a reasonably, like, near perfect squat ... And I could still do a near perfect squat."

>Martin, who's done some work with us, right? He basically, over a three-month period, broke me down to nothing. We isolated what the problems were that were causing me not to be able to squat. I worked a lot of auxiliary muscles around the squat, worked on a lot of flexibility issues. And after about three months, I could do a reasonably, like, near perfect squat, not with crazy heavy weight, but like a near perfect squat. And I could still do a near perfect squat. But I had to work on the fundamental issues that were preventing me from being able to do that. But here's something like bad behaviors, resorting to old habits, whatever. The reason they're doing that is because they haven't changed the thing that is causing those behaviors to exhibit. Like you can't tell me that, you know, oh, we're agile. You shouldn't manage dependencies now, but we have dependencies. So if it's a bad habit to manage dependencies and plan dependencies and plan ahead for dependencies, you're agile, you tell me it's a bad habit, when do the dependencies get resolved? Well the reality is that they don't get resolved, right? And so you don't deliver in a way that actually works, right? And so they're resorting to old habits. That's not a problem with what because they're doing what's necessary to stay alive, right? And ([Time 0:30:31](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c5fe3f85-79ec-4ec2-865e-3b825a9c21a8)) #✂️
