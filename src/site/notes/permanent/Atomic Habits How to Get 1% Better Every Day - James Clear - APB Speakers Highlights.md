## Metadata
- Document Note: - If you were able improve 1% once per day, you'd be 38x better by end of year
   4 Stages of Habit Formation:
   - Noticing
   - Implementation Intentions
   - When
   - Where
   - How
   - Remove Decision Making
   - Failure Premortem
   - Think about what you want to work on
   - Fast Forward 6 months and describe what caused you to fail
   - Conditional ways of dealing with exceptions (If I miss Monday, I work out Tuesday instead)
   - Wanting
   - You can design your environment to reinforce the way you act
   - You can also be impacted by a negative environment
   - Doing
   - First: Shutup and put the reps in
   - Optimize for the starting line, not the finish line
   - Make it as easy as possible to get started
   - Liking
   - Bring a reward into the moment
   - Most good things have an immediate cost but a delayed reward
   - Best way to change long term behavior is with short term feedback
   - Get a wall calendar, and put an x on every day you do the thing you are building a goal
   - The actions that you take provide evidence for 'who you are', things that you do consistently/frequently is a vote for your identity
   True Change is Identity Change
   - The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader
