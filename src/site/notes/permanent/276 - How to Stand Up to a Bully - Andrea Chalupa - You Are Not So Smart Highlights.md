>[!QUOTE]  
>Understanding the Components of Changing Minds
>Summary:
>Changing minds requires empathy and understanding that human beings are motivated reasoners. It involves beliefs, attitudes, and values which are distinct mental constructs. Beliefs are estimations of truth, attitudes are valenced estimations of positive or negative qualities, and values determine where one puts time, money, and effort. Human minds are constantly changing in these regards through a process called assimilation and accommodation.

>Speaker 1
>This is going to require something of the people who are interested in this, that is going to be, at first blush, it's going to feel like I can't believe you're asking me to do this. It's going to require empathy, specifically something that my friends at NYU call cognitive empathy, which is to understand that human beings are motivated reasoners. We believe things for reasons. And if you want to take all the things that make up a mind when we're thinking about changing minds and reduce them to something that we can discuss easily, we get to talk about it in terms Of say, beliefs, attitudes, and values. And these are very different mental constructs. A belief is an estimation of whether or not something is or is not true. And you kind of measure that emotionally with confidence. How much confidence do you have that this is or is not a true statement? Then attitudes are sort of, these are valenced estimations of positive or negative qualities. So we often get these two mixed up because if I ask you, is chocolate ice cream delicious? And you say, yes, and you can feel like you believe chocolate ice cream is delicious, but it's not really a belief. That's an attitude. You have a positive association with this thing. So it's important to see that as separate from belief. You can believe that you have a positive attitude toward chocolate ice cream. So you can see that starts to getting nice and complex very quickly. And then a value is going to be where do you think you ought to put your time, money, and effort? Where should you be putting all of your resources? What's most important to you in that way? And a person who isn't doing such a thing or is working against that could be seen as someone who is violating your value structure. So those are the three things that are always changing. Human minds are constantly changing in those three regards through a process called assimilation and accommodation.
