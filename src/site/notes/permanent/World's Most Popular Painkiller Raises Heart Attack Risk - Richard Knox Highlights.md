>A slew of studies, though, show [diclofenac](http://www.rxlist.com/voltaren-drug.htm) — sold under the brand names Voltaren, Cambia, Cataflam and Zipsor — is just as likely to cause a heart attack as the discredited painkiller Vioxx (rofecoxib), which was [pulled from the U.S. market](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4054991) in 2004.

>Henry tells Shots that diclofenac raises the risk of a cardiovascular "event" such as heart attack by about 40 percent, compared to taking no NSAID. Other NSAIDS are much safer, with [naproxen](http://www.drugs.com/naproxen.html) being the least risky. Naproxen has a global market share of only 10 percent.

>Diclofenac, which dates to the 1970s, is one of the oldest NSAIDs.
