>Event-driven architectures have three key components: event producers, event routers, and event consumers. A producer publishes an event to the router, which filters and pushes the events to consumers. Producer services and consumer services are decoupled, which allows them to be scaled, updated, and deployed independently.

>To set yourself up for success, consider the following:
>• The durability of your event source. Your event source should be reliable and guarantee delivery if you need to process every single event.
>• Your performance control requirements. Your application should be able to handle the asynchronous nature of event routers.
>• Your event flow tracking. The indirection introduced by an event-driven architecture allows for dynamic tracking via monitoring services, but not static tracking via code analysis.
>• The data in your event source. If you need to rebuild state, your event source should be deduplicated and ordered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrtc9hpprahwba5b4khhfeg1)) #✂️
