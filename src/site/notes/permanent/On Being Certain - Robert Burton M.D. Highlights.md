### Preface
>[!QUOTE]  
>Despite how certainty feels, it is neither a conscious choice nor even a thought process. Certainty and similar states of “knowing what we know” arise out of involuntary brain mechanisms that, like love or anger, function independently of reason.

### The Feeling of Knowing
*New highlights added April 15, 2024 at 9:50 AM* #📫
>[!QUOTE]  
>EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR with the most commonly recognized feeling of knowing. When asked a question, you feel strongly that you know an answer that you cannot immediately recall. Psychologists refer to this hard-to-describe but easily recognizable feeling as a tip-of-the-tongue sensation. The frequent accompanying comment as you scan your mental Rolodex for the forgotten name or phone number: “I know it, but I just can’t think of it.” In this example, you are aware of knowing something, without knowing what this sense of knowing refers to.

>[!QUOTE]  
>At this simplest level of understanding, there are two components to our understanding—the knowledge that 2 + 2 = 4, and the judgment or assessment of this understanding. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=144)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>At a deeper level, most of us have agonized over those sickening “crises of faith” when firmly held personal beliefs are suddenly stripped of a visceral sense of correctness, rightness, or meaning. Our most considered beliefs suddenly don’t “feel right.” Similarly, most of us have been shocked to hear that a close friend or relative has died unexpectedly, and yet we “feel” that he is still alive. Such upsetting news often takes time to “sink in.” This disbelief associated with hearing about a death is an example of the sometimes complete disassociation between intellectual and felt knowledge.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The kite paragraph raises several questions central to our understanding of how we “know” something. Though each will be discussed at greater length in subsequent chapters, here’s a sneak preview.   • Did you consciously “decide” that kite was the correct explanation for the paragraph, or did this decision occur involuntarily, outside of conscious awareness?   • What brain mechanism(s) created the shift from not knowing to knowing?   • When did this shift take place? (Did you know that the explanation was correct before, during, or after you reread the paragraph?)   • After rereading the paragraph, are you able to consciously separate out the feeling of knowing that kite is the correct answer from a reasoned understanding that the answer is correct?   • Are you sure that kite is the correct answer? If so, how do you know? ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=171)) #✂️

### How Do We Know What We Know?
#### Out of Sight Is Not Out of Mind
#### The Challenger Study
#### Cognitive Dissonance
*New highlights added April 16, 2024 at 8:56 AM* #📫
>[!QUOTE]  
>In 1957, Stanford professor of social psychology Leon Festinger introduced the term cognitive dissonance to describe the distressing mental state in which people “find themselves doing things that don’t fit with what they know, or having opinions that do not fit with other opinions they hold.” ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=249)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>The more committed we are to a belief, the harder it is to relinquish, even in the face of overwhelming contradictory evidence. Instead of acknowledging an error in judgment and abandoning the opinion, we tend to develop a new attitude or belief that will justify retaining it.

#### A Scientist Contemplates Creationism
##### A Patient Confronts the Placebo Effect
##### Cotard’s Syndrome
>[!QUOTE]  
>Although not restricted to a single area of the brain or a single definitive physiology, the most striking shared characteristic of these delusional misidentification syndromes is that the conflict between logic and a contrary feeling of knowing tends to be resolved in favor of feeling. Rather than rejecting ideas and beliefs that defy common sense and overwhelming contrary evidence, such patients end up using tortured logic to justify the more powerful sense of knowing what they know.8 ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=317)) #✂️

##### It May Be Right, But It’s Not Right
### Conviction Isn’t a Choice
>[!QUOTE]  
>“Mystical truth … resembles the knowledge given to us in sensations more than that given by conceptual thought.”4 James’s description is perfectly straightforward—with mystical states, people experience spontaneous mental sensations that feel like knowledge but occur in the absence of any specific knowledge. Felt knowledge. Knowledge without thought. Certainty without deliberation or even conscious awareness of having had a thought.

Note also that chloroform evoked the sensations of purity and truth without any reference to any specific idea or thought.

#### Voices from the Limbic System
>[!QUOTE]  
>LeDoux’s experiments greatly clarified the role of the amygdala in evoking a fear response without the need for any conscious awareness and recognition of the provoking stimulus.17 Other experiments have confirmed that direct stimulation of the amygdala produces the same fear response as Ledoux’s conditioning experiments. Conversely, bilateral removal of the amygdala in animals, from rats to monkeys, produces a state of utter fearlessness.

#### Organizing Complexity
#### Modules
>[!QUOTE]  
>A cell might respond to a particular shape but not another. A cluster of these highly individualized neurons specific to a single visual function is referred to as a module. ([Location 815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=815)) #✂️

#### The Hierarchical Arrangement of Sensory Data
>[!QUOTE]  
>Your retina detects an orange-and-black fluttering. The information is sent to the primary visual cortex. Each category of module gathers its own particular data (such as the detection of vertical or horizontal motion, color, shape, and size). No single module can create a visual image. Rather the output of each flows into higher order networks within the visual association areas where it merges with a host of inputs from nonvisual circuitry—the ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=818)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-710779002}

#### Emergence
>[!QUOTE]  
>A classical example of emergence is how termites with their tiny brains are able to construct huge mounds up to twenty-five feet in height. No termite has a clue how or why to build a mound; its brain isn’t large enough to carry the information. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=843)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-710779004}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Somehow the interaction of lower-level capabilities produces a higher-level activity.3 The same process applies to the human brain. Each neuron is like a termite. It cannot contain a complete memory or hold an intelligent discussion. There are no superneurons, nor is there a master plan contained within each neuron. Each neuron’s DNA provides general instructions for how a cell operates and relates with other cells; it does not provide instructions for logic, reason, or poetry. And yet, out of this mass of cells comes Shakespeare and Newton. Consciousness, intentionality, purpose, and meaning all emerge from the interconnections between billions of neurons that do not contain these elements.

>Modularity, when combined with a schematic hierarchical arrangement of increasingly complex layers of neural networks and the concept of emergence, serves as an excellent working model for how the brain builds up complex perceptions, thoughts, and behavior.

>Consider the myriad components involved in the acquisition of language, ranging from the visual recognition of symbols and auditory processing of spoken sounds (phonemes) to the sorting out of nuance and implied irony. A racial epithet can be an accusation or a term of endearment, depending upon circumstance, facial expression, body language, and intonation. (Comedian George Carlin has made a career out of forcing us to hear politically loaded words from unanticipated angles.) In the interpretation of a single word, large areas of widely separated but interconnected cortex function as a behavioral unit—hence the applicability of the term module.

>The feeling of knowing is universal, most likely originates within a localized region of the brain, can be spontaneously activated via direct stimulation or chemical manipulation, yet cannot be triggered by conscious effort. These arguments for its inclusion as a primary brain module are more compelling than those postulated for deceit, compassion, forgiveness, altruism, or Machiavellian cunning.

#### Synesthesia

#### Private Islands
>[!QUOTE]  
>Synesthesia offers a startling insight: Lower-level brain modules can profoundly affect not only our ordinary sensory perceptions but also how we experience abstract symbols such as letters and numbers. If thought is the manipulation of words and symbols, we need to consider whether our very building blocks of thought might also be subject to involuntary, even genetic, influences that make each of us “private islands” of perception and thinking.

>To have unconditional trust that a feeling of knowing represents a justifiable conclusion, we need to know which of these three scenarios has actually occurred. Timing is everything. But what if the brain contains mechanisms that rearrange the perception of a sequence of events? What if our brains can trick us into believing that event X follows event Y, even though it actually precedes it? Sounds like a preposterous proposition, but what if this rearrangement is necessary to overcome yet other physiological barriers to the proper perception of a sequence of events?

The listener’s decision as to the thought’s correctness will be based upon a quick glimpse of the idea leaving the other’s lips, snap judgments of body language, sighs, gestures, facial expressions, and all the various verbal and nonverbal contributions to interpretation of the spoken word. If the listener is forced to make a quick response, the decision as to the thought’s correctness will be subject to the same physiological restraints as a batter’s assessment of an incoming pitch. Nevertheless, due to the subjective backward referral of time, the listener will feel that he fully considered the idea before deciding on its correctness (the equivalent of Barry Bonds believing that he can see the ball in a quarter-sized strike zone before initiating his swing).
