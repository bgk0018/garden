### Preface
>[!QUOTE]  
>Despite how certainty feels, it is neither a conscious choice nor even a thought process. Certainty and similar states of “knowing what we know” arise out of involuntary brain mechanisms that, like love or anger, function independently of reason.

### The Feeling of Knowing
*New highlights added April 15, 2024 at 9:50 AM* #📫
>[!QUOTE]  
>EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR with the most commonly recognized feeling of knowing. When asked a question, you feel strongly that you know an answer that you cannot immediately recall. Psychologists refer to this hard-to-describe but easily recognizable feeling as a tip-of-the-tongue sensation. The frequent accompanying comment as you scan your mental Rolodex for the forgotten name or phone number: “I know it, but I just can’t think of it.” In this example, you are aware of knowing something, without knowing what this sense of knowing refers to.

>At this simplest level of understanding, there are two components to our understanding—the knowledge that 2 + 2 = 4, and the judgment or assessment of this understanding. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=144)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>At a deeper level, most of us have agonized over those sickening “crises of faith” when firmly held personal beliefs are suddenly stripped of a visceral sense of correctness, rightness, or meaning. Our most considered beliefs suddenly don’t “feel right.” Similarly, most of us have been shocked to hear that a close friend or relative has died unexpectedly, and yet we “feel” that he is still alive. Such upsetting news often takes time to “sink in.” This disbelief associated with hearing about a death is an example of the sometimes complete disassociation between intellectual and felt knowledge.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The kite paragraph raises several questions central to our understanding of how we “know” something. Though each will be discussed at greater length in subsequent chapters, here’s a sneak preview.   • Did you consciously “decide” that kite was the correct explanation for the paragraph, or did this decision occur involuntarily, outside of conscious awareness?   • What brain mechanism(s) created the shift from not knowing to knowing?   • When did this shift take place? (Did you know that the explanation was correct before, during, or after you reread the paragraph?)   • After rereading the paragraph, are you able to consciously separate out the feeling of knowing that kite is the correct answer from a reasoned understanding that the answer is correct?   • Are you sure that kite is the correct answer? If so, how do you know? ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=171)) #✂️
