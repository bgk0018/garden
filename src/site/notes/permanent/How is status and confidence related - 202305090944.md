How is status and confidence related? I was wondering about what's the difference in risk in social situations between those considered high status versus lower status? Are high status people willing to take more risk because less of their status is tied to outside perception? Are there different kinds of status that are more subject to social failures?

This could be answered by [[reference/The Status Game - Will Storr\|The Status Game]]
