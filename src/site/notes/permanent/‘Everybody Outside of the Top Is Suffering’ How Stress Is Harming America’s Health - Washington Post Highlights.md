>But they speculate that factors such as job market stress, depression and the quality of health care and diets could be causing the health of lower-income Americans to diverge from their upper-income counterparts. Lower-income Americans who have struggled economically are more likely to experience financial and psychological stress, be exposed to violence and environmental hazards, receive lower quality health care, eat lower-quality food and live in substandard housing, researchers say. Policies like food stamps or housing assistance may help improve the situation, the report says. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htsptvqpe3q99ja4za3dtxj5)) #✂️ #👻 ai highlighted
