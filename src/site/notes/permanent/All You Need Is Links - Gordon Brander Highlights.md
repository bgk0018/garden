>[!QUOTE]  
>[Semantic triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple) are one of those ideas you run into if you poke around the “tools for thought” space long enough. A semantic triple is a simple idea with some powerful properties. The basic idea is to construct a network made up of:
>Subject - Predicate - Object ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt68h3y36wxrhw8z0eqqqmk)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>Triples allow computers to do complex automated reasoning. You can even use them to derive relationships that aren’t explicitly stated. You know those answer cards that appear in Google searches? Those are largely constructed from Google Knowledge Graph, [a giant network of semantic triples](https://inlinks.net/p/knowledge-graph-explained/).

>[!QUOTE]  
>It seems a triple is a **link** between two things, *through* a predicate. Here is yet another thing we can reimagine through the mechanism of links.
>**A hyperlink is a triple where the subject is the page, the predicate is the link text, and the object is the thing being linked to**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpt6a1b7e87341we41fnr99m)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>[Topic modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) is a range of machine learning techniques for deriving abstract topics from a collection of documents using statistical analysis. I put in a collection of Subconscious newsletters, and topic modeling tells me they’re about tools for thought, cybernetics, the web, computing, distributed systems, etc. Pretty cool.
