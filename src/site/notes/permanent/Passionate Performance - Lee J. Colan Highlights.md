### INTRODUCTION
>[!QUOTE]  
>The bottom line is that people buy from people, not companies. So, your people - and the performance they deliver - are the defining competitive advantage for your organization. ([Location 45](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=45)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217782}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>When people are engaged in their work and feel a deep connection to it, they deliver Passionate Performance. ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=46)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217783}

>[!QUOTE]  
>They invest time, energy and resources to engage their people because engaged employees are more likely to: stay with the organization; perform at higher levels; influence others to perform well; promote the organization externally; and deliver unparalleled customer service. ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=55)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217784}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Passionate Performance cannot be easily duplicated by your competition and creates a rock-solid wall of differentiation between you and the rest of the pack. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=63)) #✂️

### THE ANATOMY OF PASSIONATE PERFORMANCE
>[!QUOTE]  
>Passionate Performance is achieved when employees are fully engaged - when they demonstrate a strong, sustained intellectual and emotional attachment to their work. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=74)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217786}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Look for signs of the big payoff from Passionate Performance: discretionary effort- people choosing to do more for you. You’ll know your employees are giving discretionary effort when they: choose to work late to complete a project; ask how they can better serve another team member or department; inquire about how their actions affect another function or the customer; make a connection between their decisions and the company’s financial results; treat company resources like their own; initiate improvements in work methods; look beyond their own roles for improvement opportunities; and pursue self-development on their own time. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=85)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217787}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>74% of employees are either indifferent to their work or actively disengaged. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=105)) #✂️

{ #ref-518217790}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Therefore, achieving Passionate Performance is a two-sided challenge: intellectual and emotional. Successful leaders engage both the minds and hearts of their people. ([Location 142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=142)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217791}

### ENGAGING THE MIND
>[!QUOTE]  
>The mind represents the intellectual aspects of people that are based on reason, logic, and cause and effect. It requires the science of leadership which is the focus of most leadership training and education. Engaging the mind builds employee performance. ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=163)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217793}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>It’s no surprise that, as leaders, we can also sometimes forget the basics. The basics of our “sport” involve meeting employees’ three intellectual needs: 1. Achievement 2. Autonomy 3. Mastery ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=172)) #✂️

{ #ref-518217795}

{ #ref-518217798}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Some common barriers to employee achievement that leaders can control include: insufficient materials, equipment or tools; lack of authority to accomplish goals; slow or unclear decision-making processes; and undefined goals.

{ #ref-518217802}

{ #ref-518217803}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Clear goals make it easier for employees to achieve because they can better prioritize their time and energy to focus on things that are important to your team’s success. ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=212)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217804}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>While achievement focuses on the outcome of your employees’ work, autonomy focuses on the process of getting work done. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=229)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217805}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>The first strategy to fulfill this need is to involve your employees in defining and improving their work processes. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=232)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217806}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>People support what they help create. When employees support the process, they are much more likely to give discretionary effort. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=235)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217807}

{ #ref-518217808}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Determine the appropriate boundaries for your team. Your organizational values can give you a hint as to what these boundaries should be (e.g., teamwork, innovation, mutual respect, customer focus, open communication, fact-based decision making, etc.). These boundaries will help you define the playing field within which employees can use their skills and creativity to get work done. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=248)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217809}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>One of the strongest intellectual drives people have is to do something well - to master something. We are born with this need. Consider a baby who is learning to walk. Despite countless trips, stumbles, bumps and bruises, a baby’s need to master the skill of walking remains strong until s/he can do it effortlessly. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=271)) #✂️

{ #ref-518217811}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Combine tasks that require similar skill levels so you can more easily match the person’s skills to the position’s requirements. Automate repetitive tasks. Remember, you’re trying to engage, not disengage, employees’ minds. Streamline inefficient processes and eliminate redundant tasks that prevent employees from building mastery in the critical parts of their jobs. Outsource tasks that require significant effort but have little impact on the organization. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=292)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217812}


---
>[!QUOTE]

### ENGAGING THE HEART

{ #ref-518217819}

{ #ref-518217820}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Your team should be the focal point for developing these connections, and there are two strategies you can use to accomplish this: maintain smallness and create rituals. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=407)) #✂️

{ #ref-518217822}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>The second strategy for meeting the intimacy need is to create rituals. Engaging leaders do what other leaders might consider to be corny. These leaders make it a priority to establish rituals and “traditions” that connect employees to each other and to the customer. The purpose is to foster intimacy, belonging and fun. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=431)) #✂️

{ #ref-518217825}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>The engaging leader also knows that appreciating the person is just as important as appreciating contributions. A study of over 20,000 leaders found that the most effective ones had one thing in common: They expressed a sincere interest in, and appreciation for, their employees as people. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001QS9TES&location=484)) #✂️
