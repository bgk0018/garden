### Introduction
>[!QUOTE]  
>Gallup research indicates that there’s approximately $500 billion in lost productivity annually, in the United States alone, due to negative behavior in organizations. Other research has estimated that managers spend as much as 40% of their time dealing with conflict and drama. ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=74)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>At a minimum, workplace drama causes inefficiency, frustration, and waste. The personal costs to those who work in organizations is immeasurable. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=77)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217187}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Then, I came across an article by Peter Senge (“Building Learning Organizations,” published in the March 1992 issue of the Journal for Quality and Participation). ([Location 108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=108)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217188}

>[!QUOTE]  
>The article referred to these three dimensions simply as A, B, and C (see also Diagram 1): The production and delivery of products and/or services. This is “the work” we engage in to serve our customers and clients. The design and implementation of the systems, processes, and structures that enable the work to be done. The primary responsibility for this dimension is held by management. The way we think about how we think, interact, and take action. To quote Senge’s article, “Ultimately, the quality of [this] work determines the quality of the systems and processes [that organizations] design and the products and services [they] provide” (p. 35). This is the work of leadership—which can include anyone, anywhere in the organization. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=112)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>Douglas McGregor, at MIT’s Sloan School of Management in the 1940s, developed a theory of employee motivation that addresses thinking about how we think, interact, and act. He called it, simply, Theory X and Theory Y. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=122)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217190}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Theory X sees employees (and co-workers) as problems. It assumes that people are basically lazy and will avoid work if they can, so they need to be controlled and threatened with punishment if they do not perform.

{ #ref-518217191}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Theory Y, on the other hand, assumes that employees and co-workers are inherently self-motivated and seek out work and responsibility that satisfies their desire to create products and services that meet the needs of others.

>[!QUOTE]  
>And here it is, the fundamental reason: most change initiatives are rooted in dimension B—management’s systems, processes and structures—without any consideration for, let alone work within, dimension C, which is how we’re thinking about how we work.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Question 1. Where are you putting your focus? Are you focusing on problems or on outcomes? Question 2. How are you relating? How are you relating to others, to your experience, and even to yourself? Are you relating in ways that produce or perpetuate drama, or in ways that empower others and yourself to be more resourceful, resilient, and innovative? Question 3. What actions are you taking? Are you merely reacting to the problems of the moment, or are you taking creative and generative action—including the solving of problems—in service to outcomes?

{ #ref-518217202}

>[!QUOTE]  
>“The F in FISBE stands for focus,” he said, writing the word in the top circle, “and this focus sets up the rest of the operating system. That’s because whatever you focus on, that’s what gets your inner state going. ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=308)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217203}

{ #ref-518217205}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>we human beings are cognitive—or thinking—creatures. Our thoughts set up our focus. We’re also emotional beings. Our emotions determine our inner state. And, of course, as individuals and groups, we take actions and engage in behaviors,” ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=317)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217206}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“You can see how the same situation triggered positive thoughts for one person and negative thoughts for the other—their focus was different. This caused them to experience very different inner states, which then led to very different actions, or behaviors. The same situation, with different FISBEs, created two totally different experiences.” ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=338)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217207}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“As you might suspect, the focus here is on problems,” he said, and he wrote Problem in the focus circle. “A problem can show up in all kinds of ways: maybe someone emails you, or calls or texts you. Or maybe someone walks into your office and starts talking about a problem. “As you take in this new information as a problem,” said Ted, “your inner state arises—and that’s going to be some kind of anxiety.” Ted wrote Anxiety in the inner state circle. “Then, depending on how bad you think the problem is, your anxiety could be anything from a little irritation to intense fear. Either way, the inner state of anxiety will trigger you into action. “This action you take—that’s your behavior, of course—is some form of reaction.

{ #ref-518217209}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“You’re telling yourself you’re reacting to the problem, when really you’re reacting to the anxiety you feel about the problem. If you didn’t feel some level of anxiety, you’d let the situation pass on by. The false assumption is that the problem is driving this operating system. But it isn’t—the Problem Orientation, the operating system, only sets it in motion. It’s actually your anxiety that’s driving the whole shebang.” ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=375)) #✂️

{ #ref-518217211}

>[!QUOTE]  
>“Another problem. Seems like there’s always a new issue lurking under the last one. I’m just waiting for the next incoming problem!” “And that’s why it’s a false hope that problems will go away,” ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=386)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217212}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“In this orientation, you have a much different focus. Here your thinking is oriented toward envisioning an outcome. Sometimes the outcome you have in mind is clear—you know almost exactly what it is and how you want it to happen. Other times this outcome may be somewhat vague in your mind, but you have a general idea of the direction you’re heading. ([Location 401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=401)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217213}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“What’s important is that you care about the outcome you envision. Because when you really care about it, that ignites an inner state of passion,” said Ted, and he wrote the word Passion in the inner state circle. In the behavior circle he wrote Baby Step, then turned to face Lucas. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=404)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217214}

{ #ref-518217218}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“your attention begins to move naturally toward whatever it is that you do want, and what you really care about. That doesn’t mean you won’t have any more problems, but it does mean there will be a big shift in your relationship to those problems. Instead of seeing problems everywhere you look, you start taking on only the problems that need to be solved to create the outcome you want. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=444)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217219}

{ #ref-518217220}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“your intention is to move toward the outcome and, through the baby steps, or the actions you take, to bring that intention into being over time.” Lucas joined in. “So, the difference is between moving away from what you don’t want—the problem—and moving toward the outcome you do want.” ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=457)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217221}

#### CHAPTER THREE The Predictable Pattern of Results
>[!QUOTE]  
>Ted added, “So anytime you find yourself faced with a situation that seems to come up over and over again—be it with a team member at work, someone in your personal life, or even within yourself—it is virtually guaranteed you’re coming at that situation from the Problem Orientation. You do something about the situation, it gets better for a while, and then sometime down the road, there it is again!

{ #ref-518217222}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“As you focus on your envisioned outcome, your passion goes up.” He drew a plus sign. “As your passion increases, your desire to take the next baby step increases, too.” Another plus sign. “Then, as you take that next step, you get closer to, or clearer about, the outcome”—a third plus sign on the board—“and that increases your passion and your will to take action.” ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=516)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217223}

>“In the Problem Orientation, you unwittingly allow circumstances to define your focus by giving your attention to whatever is generating anxiety. ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=536)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217224}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>But in the Outcome Orientation, you cultivate a very different relationship with problems. Because you have a vision of the outcome you want to create, you’re able to pick and choose which problems really deserve your attention, focus, and energy. Then you can prioritize—dealing only with the problems most likely to help create that outcome. Anxiety may still be there, but you’re no longer driven to react to it.” ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=541)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217225}

#### CHAPTER FOUR Discovering a Co-Creator
>[!QUOTE]  
>‘Every job can have either a trivial description or a noble one.’” ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=658)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217226}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“The first exercise has to do with the thoughts and feelings you experience … and the actions you take … in each of the orientations. And just a note about ‘thoughts’—they can be things you say silently to yourself as well as things you say out loud to other people,” Kasey explained. Lucas wrote “thoughts, feelings, and actions” ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=674)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217227}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“A reactive trigger is anything or anyone that causes or activates you to react—to see that person or thing as a problem that engages some form of anxiety. Once you’re triggered, you react with a fight, flight, freeze, or appease response. Those are the reactive strategies. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=703)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217228}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Being able to step back and reflect on things is really key, Lucas. Ted calls it ‘going up to the balcony.’ The more you can observe, the more you will be able to make different and more empowering choices about how to respond. It will be great to get into the habit of writing down your observations of thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and actions, as well as your reactive triggers and reactive strategies.” ([Location 722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=722)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217229}

### VITAL QUESTION 2 How are you relating?
#### CHAPTER FIVE How Are You Relating?
>[!QUOTE]  
>the Problem Orientation is actually a Victim Orientation, because usually we feel victimized by the problems we’re reacting to. On the other hand, the Outcome Orientation is really a Creator Orientation, from which you create outcomes and the baby steps you’ll take to accomplish those outcomes. ([Location 813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=813)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905048}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>One is, How are you relating to other people? Another is, How are you relating to what is going on in your life? And the third is, How you are relating to yourself? “The key here is, are you relating in ways that are going to produce or perpetuate drama, or are you relating in ways that empower yourself and others to be more resourceful, resilient, and innovative?” ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=822)) #✂️

>Stephen Karpman identified a triangle of relationship roles that make up what you might call the Dreaded Drama Triangle, or DDT. ([Location 832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=832)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905050}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“The central role in the DDT is the role of Victim, Lucas. And here’s a rule you can go by: anytime you find yourself complaining—whenever there is something you want or care about that you feel powerless to have, do, or be—then you know you’re stuck in the Victim role,” ([Location 836](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=836)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905051}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“But feeling victimized is very different from victimhood,” said Ted. “Sadly, victimhood can become a whole self-identity, a way of being in life that keeps you feeling like you have no choice, that life is just happening to you and you can’t do anything to change it. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=844)) #✂️

{ #ref-521905053}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“While you might think of a Persecutor as a person—like your new boss, maybe—there are other forms a Persecutor can take. It might be a health condition, such as heart disease or diabetes. The Persecutor also could be a situation such as a hurricane or earthquake, or any of the other tragic events we see on the news. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=855)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905054}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“When the Persecutor is a person, often they seek to control and dominate the drama. They actually fear their own victimization, so they become aggressive. Then they can easily blame the Victim for whatever is happening. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=864)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905055}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>The Persecutor is ‘the problem’ that the Victim is reacting to out of fear or anxiety.” Ted put down his marker. “Does that sound familiar?” ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=866)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905056}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“There are three ways a Rescuer can come in and complete the DDT. One, the Victim goes looking for a Rescuer and invites them into the drama. Second, someone intervenes to either take care of or fix the Victim, or goes after the Persecutor to protect the Victim. Then the third kind of Rescuer could be someone or some situation that the Victim hopes will emerge to, as you say, ‘save the day.’ ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=873)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905057}

>[!QUOTE]  
>the shadow side of the Rescuer individual is that, while their actions are usually well-intended, taking care of or fixing the Victim only reinforces the Victim’s feelings of powerlessness and resentment about their victimization.” ([Location 883](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=883)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905058}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“And what’s more, the Rescuer takes actions based on fear, too, just like the Persecutor does. The Rescuer’s fear is that they will not be needed—so they seek out a Victim they can ‘help.’ This renews the Rescuer’s sense of purpose—to fix or protect or take care of the Victim.

>[!QUOTE]  
>being a Creator has two main characteristics. First, a Creator focuses on creating outcomes, just as we talked about earlier. The second characteristic—and this is really important—is that a Creator takes responsibility for the way they respond to whatever happens in their experience. Creators do this even when they feel victimized.” ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=930)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905061}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>“Wait a minute. Are you saying that a Creator chooses a fight, flight, freeze, or appease reaction to whatever is going on? Isn’t that what Victims do?” “You’re so right,” Ted said. “The choosing is the big difference here, as well as the range of choices. There is actually a big difference between just reacting to a situation and choosing how to respond to it.” ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=932)) #✂️

In our response lies our growth and our freedom.” “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” ([Location 942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NGNFVNQ&location=942)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-521905063}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Challengers spark learning and growth. When something happens and you feel victimized, if you can ask ‘What can I learn from this person, this condition, or this situation?’ instead of reacting to it as though it’s your Persecutor … well, then you’ve unlocked the secret to the Challenger role.
