>[!QUOTE]  
>House and Senate Disagree on Spending Bills: Clash over Top Line Spending Level and Riders
>Key takeaways:
>- Spending bills in the House and Senate are not aligned, causing disagreement on top line spending levels.
>- The Senate has passed bills in line with the agreed spending numbers, while the House has moved bills that are below the agreed spending levels.
>- The Senate's bipartisan approach to spending contrasts with the contentious bills proposed by House Republicans.
>- Cultural and political issues, including LGBTQ rights, abortion access, and diversity programs, are being included as riders in spending bills.
>- People may become cynical about government when agreements between politicians fall apart.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 1
>And he said after the deal was cut that he was going to tell the Appropriations Committee, which passes the 12 annual spending bills, hey, that number was a ceiling, not a floor. So the House Republicans have been moving bills, very contentious bills through committee that are below the spending agreements that Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy set. And so meanwhile, on the Senate side, they've been passing bills at exactly the numbers that Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy agreed to. Not only that, they've agreed to spend more money, which is only going to make the House angry. So you have on the one hand, this spending, top line spending level that the House and Senate just don't agree to. The Senate's been moving in a big bipartisan fashion. And also I'd say, there's going to be a big culture war issue on a lot of these spending bills because Republicans are putting things into these bills called riders. That affect things from LGBTQ rights and access and earmarks to abortion access to things like racial and gender politics, trying to defund programs for things like diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the breadth of the federal government.
>Speaker 2
>So why not pause here? Because I do think that there is, I don't know, maybe a bit of like a naive assumption that Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy did shake hands and kind of had an agreement here. And this is what makes people cynical about government, right, in Washington is that they had an agreement and now you're telling us that like everything fell apart. I don't understand. Is that just the normal way that things go here? ([Time 0:10:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0de15455-bba6-4263-8313-7454963bee88)) #✂️
