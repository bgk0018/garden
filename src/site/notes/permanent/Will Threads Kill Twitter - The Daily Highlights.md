>So, you know, if you and I are not paying for Twitter, we only get to basically see like several hundred tweets a day now before we're cut off, which I don't know about you, but for me, that is not a lot. That's probably me in like 15 minutes before I'm done scrolling. Right. Maybe that says something about me. But for Musk, this is really about charging other companies for something they shouldn't be getting for free, which I don't, I mean, I think that's not crazy. I think there are other companies doing that right now too. Reddit has said that they're trying to lock down their data, tell Google and other companies to stop taking their data for free. The problem is he did it in the worst possible way and made everyone else upset across the service, including, you know, folks like you and I who use it regularly. But we also know Musk is in this bad place financially with his server agreements, right? You know, Twitter doesn't really rely on its own servers to keep it up and running all the time. He just servers at Google and Amazon and pays, you know, billions of dollars in bills to do that every year. And Musk hasn't been either able or willing to pay for the amount of server space he actually needs to keep Twitter running. So you can also look at the tweet limits as a way for him to kind of save money on those bills. It's probably not all about AI.
