>[!QUOTE]  
>Balancing Emotions Towards Well-being
>Summary:
>The concept of balancing emotions is crucial for well-being, as illustrated by four types of psychopathology: clinical anxiety, clinical depression, excessive anger, and mania from excessive happiness.
>The speaker emphasizes the importance of avoiding extremes in emotions, even positive ones, to maintain mental health. The example of receiving a table from a high-achiever who valued excellence over striving further emphasizes the need for emotional equilibrium in all aspects of life.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 1
>It had four rows and the four rows were four kinds of psychopathology. So you had clinical levels of anxiety as opposed to healthy levels of anxiety. You had clinical levels of depression as opposed to adaptive and normal levels of sadness. You had too much anger. That's the extreme of having an appropriate amount of anger because a person who's not able to feel angry will not be able to defend themselves or express themselves. And the fourth row was actually not a psychopathology, at least not in obvious ways. So the fourth row was actually happiness and you're like, oh, the fourth row, that's where I want to be. The happy row, but actually any of these things taken to extreme is bad, like too much happiness is mania. But the reason I bring all this up is that when he sent me that table, it really brought home the point that you can jump the shark in kind of obvious ways, but even in non obvious ways. And so it's also being sent to me by somebody who can only be described as a high achiever. Like he loved to talk about grit. He loved grit. He was not like Angela, I want to talk to you about grit because in my years of clinical practice, what I've seen is too much striving. He was like, I want to talk to you about grit because I'm really interested in excellence. So I say all this to say, yeah, you can jump the shark in anything.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Unconditional Positive Regard and Perfectionism
>Summary:
>Unconditional positive regard emphasizes the importance of believing in one's self-worth independent of external achievements.
>It is the foundation for a bedrock self-esteem that enables individuals to persevere regardless of the outcome. Perfectionism, on the other hand, does not guarantee success and is not consistently linked to achievement.
>In the age of social media, this belief is challenged, leading individuals to strive excessively for perfection.
>However, understanding that self-worth is not tied to grades or performance can help individuals persist even in the face of imperfection.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 1
>So what unconditional positive regard is, and this was the idea of therapists who actually came in the generation right before Tim Beck, I'd say, is the idea that all of us, whether we're Young or old, need to believe that we're enough. We need to believe in some sense that without any contingencies, whatever our grade was, however good our TED talk was, or whatever, that our worth is completely unbound to that. It's unconditional. And when you actually dig deeper into what Thomas Karen writes about perfectionism, I think what he worries is that perfectionists don't have that bedrock self-esteem, that sense That I'm going to go out there and do my best. And if I come home, and it is a B minus, that I'm not somehow not as much of a person anymore. And I think this old idea, it's not actually even used so much now when we train psychotherapists. I think that's exactly right. I think that's what social media undermines. And I think maybe that is why some of the people that I study, they go out and they try so hard every day. And when they come home and it wasn't perfect, they're still able to get up again the next morning because their worth is actually not dependent on the A plus or the B minus.
>Speaker 2
>Well, that's what was most surprising to me, or the line that stuck out most of me when you're reading this from current perfectionism doesn't lead to success, he said.
>Speaker 4
>Oh, I forgot to tell you that that is one of the most important findings.
>Speaker 1
>And perfectionism is not positively correlated with achievement, not reliably so.
>Speaker 6
>Sometimes yes, sometimes no, but it's kind of a wash, which I think is fascinating, right? And I think actually the point you're making, that's why I loved that line so much. ([Time 0:33:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9c187408-ffbf-4a57-b2e1-732c4cf734bb)) #✂️
