>[!QUOTE]  
>Reframing for a Different Perspective
>Summary:
>The key insight is about the power of reframing, shifting from a negative to a positive perspective.
>By changing the focus from 'feeling X' to 'feeling why,' it can alter one's approach to a situation. This shift can lead to significant changes in attitude and behavior, ultimately influencing outcomes.
>Additionally, the concept of openness in communication is highlighted through the exchange of songs and poems as a way to increase openness among individuals.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 6
>Oh, did he?
>Speaker 2
>And they tried to kick him out over and over because no matter what happened, he would do his yes hand and then pull out a gun and be like, and you're dead. And you're dead. And it was like he ruined it every time.
>Speaker 1
>I missed that. Oh my gosh, I did not see those episodes.
>Speaker 2
>I think there are enough people like that. But no, here's what I think is fascinating about what you're saying is that I am a huge fan of the idea of reframing and I forget to do it often and therefore don't benefit from it. But what you're talking about is when you walk into a situation and say, hey, instead of feeling X, I want to feel why. Yeah, then it really does, at least for me, change everything in my approach. Right. Yeah.
>Speaker 1
>Well, look, Mike, let's end this conversation on openness. With the question of what I can do for you, I know what you're going to do for me to increase my openness. You're going to send me a song every week. I cannot wait and a poem. Oh, a song and a poem. Excellent. OK, what can I do for you? And let me remind you that there was an aspect of openness that's about aesthetics. ([Time 0:34:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7be518ae-647d-455d-820d-4c09cb65a05e)) #✂️
