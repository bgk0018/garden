>Now, when adenosine binds to an adenosine receptor,it actually sends a signal that the brain, or rather it contributes to the brain'ssensation and perception of feeling drowsy.So what will happen iscaffeine will come in there and actually plug up the receptor.Right?It fits into the receptor, but it doesn't activate it.

>[!QUOTE]  
>But the point is there is a baseline and the hypothalamus is more or lesstrying to figure out how do we get to that or when should we go away from it.But it will actually detect caffeine.And when it detects the caffeine, that's when it will communicateto this structure right here known as the pituitary gland.And it will tell the pituitary gland to start well or it's reallyto communicate with the adrenal glands and to start producing epinephrine ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzd11n84yt1bz6s04jtrzn00)) #✂️

>and norepinephrine, which most people know as adrenaline or noradrenaline.Let's now discuss sugar.But to be fair, many energy drinks don't come with sugar and instead comewith artificial sweeteners.However, many of those artificial sweeteners will still havesome kind of effect on the same structures and pathways we're about to discuss.Although that effect does definitely seem to be more limited.However, the artificial sweetenerSucralose doesn't seem to have really any direct effect on the brain,but instead will affect the pancreas and overall insulin sensitivity.

>And you probably know these by other names.The parasympathetic is most commonly known as the “rest and digest”,while the sympathetic nervous system is commonly known as the “fight or flight.”Now, the reason why we're talking about these at allis going to be because of epinephrine and norepinephrine.And if you recall, we've just learned that they are produced by the adrenal glandsin response to caffeine consumption.Now, I also want you to understand that while epinephrineand norepinephrine are responsible, these are the neurotransmitters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gze6z4e8f7npkty48c3y8zv0)) #✂️
