>Everyone has a “Who” network, a “community of friends” that’s been built up over many years with love and unconditional giving.

They want you to achieve your goals. And they love you just the way you are. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001O7HEF2&location=346)) #✂️

Anywhere along the time line of your life the number of your “Who” or “What” could be radically different. But the “Who” part of the equation is by far the most important component. That’s because whatever you truly want in life will always involve relationships. “Who” is preeminent! ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001O7HEF2&location=527)) #✂️

They don’t ask. No one can help if they don’t know what you want. 2. When they do ask, they ask the wrong people. For some reason, people are uncomfortable asking their “Who” for help. As a result, they’ll ask most anyone except their friends, who are the only ones with a motive to help. 3. When they do ask for help, they ask too vaguely. Even if I’m motivated to help a friend, I can’t do it when I don’t know what he or she wants. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001O7HEF2&location=797)) #✂️

I see it all the time. If the client likes you in the interview, they’ll be less concerned about your weaknesses and let you off the hook by not asking tough follow-up questions.

Author and renowned motivational speaker Jeffrey Gitomer nails it when he says, “Prepare to win, or lose to someone who is!” • Having great references, endorsements, and testimonials are your most powerful allies. When someone else says you’re great, you are! So choose your references carefully and you won’t have to toot your own horn. • The interview is usually won or lost in the first five minutes. Here is a great secret: every person carries their own, unique personal environment that is invisibly transmitted to everyone in the room. So, when you walk in, bring your very best, positively charged attitude. ([Location 1919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001O7HEF2&location=1919)) #✂️

The top two reasons for enduring happiness, it turns out, are “Gratitude and Giving. ” Dr. Baker’s study revealed that when people are truly grateful for what they have or when they deliberately choose to be givers, there is a chemical that gets released in the brain that creates a sense of euphoria, an inner peace, and a feeling of personal significance.
