>Speaker 1
>Only I get to do that. And that's that's it. And we're doing that because I can't invite people to explore what's possible with me and to see if this new way is better while simultaneously telling them that I'm the only person who's allowed to make money off of it. Or I'm the only person who's allowed to better my life and the way I want to with it. Like I can say that. But what it means is it's not about actually about the outcome. It's about me. Does that make sense? Like it means it's about whatever the money in my pocket, which it is like I want money in my pocket. I think I said that on one of these podcasts earlier. Like yeah, you have not I got no I got no shame about it. That's totally cool, right? Yeah, it is great. It's a lot better to have money than not to have money. Like I think anybody who tells you otherwise is wrong. But it's not the only reason to do it. And my ambition, our ambition for it is a big one. And you can't really think about how to get there. It's impossible really to me to imagine how to get there without building a giant community of people who share that point of view. And if you want that to happen, I can't simultaneously believe that and also say, but here are all the ways you can't make your life better. Right? If it involves you making money in the way I want to make money, I don't like that. Or if it involves you doing something, anything, I don't like you're not allowed. Or if you disagree with me in some fundamental way and you're like, Adam's totally wrong. What system initiative needs, what the system initiative software needs is to work with Git. Then you know, you got to be able to fork system initiative, make the Adam initiative. And like, which you shouldn't call it the Adam initiative because I come find you and be like, that's too close to my trademark. But you know what I mean? You can call it LaCroix or whatever. Let them sue you and make it work with Git, you know? Yeah.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The Necessity of Community in Open Source Business Models
>Key takeaways:
>- Building a community of people who share a point of view is essential to achieve a goal.
>- One cannot simultaneously believe in building a community and limiting ways in which they can improve their lives.
>- Red Hat model involves how software gets distributed, used, deployed, how money is made from it, and holding a trademark over it.
>- There are three levers in open source business models despite open source not being a business model.

>Speaker 1
>All right. So there's three levers in sort of open source business models. There are no open source business models open source is in a business model, blah, blah, blah, blah. Let us just admit that that's true. And then we're going to go on calling it open source business models because that's just what you have to do.
