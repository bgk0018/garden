## Highlights

>[!QUOTE]  
>How Much Learning Did Students Miss During the Pandemic?
>Summary:
>New research describes just how much learning students missed during the pandemic. Researchers reviewed a mountain of data covering nearly 8,000 school districts. Wealth and poverty played a big role in which students were hit hardest.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 1
>So when are you likely to know the results of Sunday's vote?
>Speaker 2
>Well, there's a good chance we will begin to start seeing some results by eight or nine Sunday night. That's Turkish time if past elections are any guide. And of course, under Turkish election law, if nobody gets more than 50% of the vote, that's 50% plus at least one vote, there has to be a runoff of just the top two candidates. And that would be something that would be likely to happen on May 28th.
>Speaker 1
>Alright, NPR's Peter Canyon. Peter, thanks. Thank you. Historic in magnitude. That's how new research describes just how much learning students missed during the pandemic.
>Speaker 2
>The researchers reviewed a mountain of data covering nearly 8,000 school districts to create the clearest picture yet of which students were hit hardest and why.
>Speaker 1
>NPR's Corey Turner joins us now, Corey. How much learning do researchers think students have missed out on? Yeah, the average student A in grades third through eighth missed half a year of math. And in reading, they missed a quarter of a year. And that's according to researchers at Harvard's Center for Education Policy Research and Stanford's Educational Opportunity Project. Now, not surprisingly, wealth and poverty played a big role here. ([Time 0:08:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/19c6428b-efa9-4bc3-8a17-9031a75806f1)) #✂️
