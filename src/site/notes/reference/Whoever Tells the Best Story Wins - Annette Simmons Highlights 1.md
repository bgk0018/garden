## Highlights

### Introduction
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best storytellers learn to use their own emotional responses as divining rods to locate and tap into the emotional responses of others. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=75)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555064}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>The old rule to “know your audience” becomes a much more fertile exercise as you adopt a storytelling approach to communication. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=96)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555065}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Zappos customer-service representatives have no scripts. Instead, they are encouraged to be creative and adapt a personalized approach to each customer and situation based on core values. Managing with stories can feel like flying without a net, but our safety nets of algorithms, policies, scripts, and rules only support the illusion that consistency translates to quality. When it comes to emotions, consistency translates to apathy. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=113)) #✂️

### Thinking in Story
#### Story Thinking
>[!QUOTE]  
>People are starving for meaningful stories, while we are surrounded by impersonal messages dressed in bells and whistles that are story-ish but no more effective than giving a mirror and bell to a starving parrot. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=155)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555069}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Facts matter, but feelings interpret what your facts mean to your audience. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=166)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555070}

##### How to S.E.E. Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>Any significant emotional event (s.e.e.) can be a story. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=168)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555072}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>If the right answers were enough, everyone who needs to lose weight would only ever have to read one diet book. Behavior change requires more than knowing what to do; we have to feel like doing it. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=175)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555073}


---
##### What’s Important and Why
>[!QUOTE]  
>The key to story thinking is to learn which stories stimulate your own feelings first. Then find the stories that also stimulate the feelings of others. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=210)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555075}


---
##### Story Thinking Is Not the Opposite of Objective Thinking
##### Relax Your Internal Critic
>[!QUOTE]  
>Whatever interaction simulates a visceral, experiential sense of meaning—to the satisfaction of the listener and the teller—is a story. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=232)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555078}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>The Western world has spent a lot of time and energy learning how to exclude emotions from decision making, but decisions that ignore emotions are easily ignored in return. Story thinking doesn’t bring emotions back to decision making, but it gives us access to the emotions that have been there since the beginning of human history. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=257)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555079}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Be gentle. Stories are very powerful tools. When you activate new stories, you transport people to new points of view and change meaning and behavior, and in that way, you change the future. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=266)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555080}


---
#### Story Is Experience Reconstituted
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best you can do is bring these transformational experiences to life with a story that is so vivid, so impactful, it feels as if the listeners were actually there. For them, a story becomes a type of personal experience, even if it is experienced vicariously. This is why I define story as a reimagined experience narrated with enough detail and feeling to cause your listeners’ imaginations to experience it as real. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=284)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555082}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Our stories help us weight data as important (or not) as well as judge the data as good or bad according to our point of view. Complexity and ambiguity are now the norm, so without proactive stories, we leave it to reactive stories to create interpretations that may or may not serve the organization. The point is that it’s to your benefit to be mindful of the stories you tell. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=295)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555083}


---
##### Stories We Tell Every Day
>[!QUOTE]  
>This book is actually designed to help you pay better attention to the stories you tell, so you can adjust the perceptions your stories build and sustain. Most of the time, we don’t realize we are telling stories. It is even less obvious how powerfully these stories impact our lives. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=300)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555085}


---
##### Who-I-Am Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>What qualities earn you the right to influence a particular person? Tell of a time, place, or event that provides evidence that you have these qualities. Reveal who you are as a person. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=310)) #✂️

{ #ref-538555089}


---
##### Teaching Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>Certain lessons are best learned from experience, and some lessons are learned over and over again—patience, for instance. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=318)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555091}


---
##### Vision Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>A worthy, exciting future story reframes present difficulties as “worth it.” Big projects and new challenges are difficult and frustrating for implementers who weren’t in on the decision. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=323)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555093}


---
##### Value-in-Action Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>If you want to encourage or teach a value, you have to provide a “demonstration” by telling a story that illustrates in action what that value means, behaviorally. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=330)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555095}


---
##### I-Know-What-You-Are-Thinking Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>It is a trust-building surprise for you to share their secret suspicions in a story that first validates and then dispels these objections without sounding defensive. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=335)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555097}


---
##### Choose the Stories You Tell
>[!QUOTE]  
>As mentioned before, if we were to judge people by the stories they tell on a daily basis, we would conclude most of them are stressed-out, misunderstood victims (Who-I-Am) here to survive red tape and stupid decisions (Why-I-Am-Here). They pine for retirement or the firing of a certain individual (Vision), and they believe that the “haves” couldn’t care less about the “have-nots” (Value-in-Action). They unconsciously tell stories that ensure coworkers learn that no amount of effort is going to change things (Teaching) because they’ve already tried and failed (I-Know-What-You-Are-Thinking). ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=338)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555099}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>When, during this typical up-and-down day, does your team experience you? When you are happy, productive, and at your best? Or when you are disappointed and frustrated? Most of us have to admit we are not that noticeable when we are happy and productive. We sort of fade into the woodwork. The times we seek attention are the times when we think a correction needs to be made. Indeed, Western culture is almost addicted to correction. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=362)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555100}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>It’s completely natural. Our brains are hardwired to pay more attention to problems rather than building relationships, teaching, communicating vision, daydreaming of innovations, or explaining misunderstandings. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=366)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555101}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>If you aren’t telling stories with intention, you may be unintentionally minimizing people’s feelings, passion, sense of purpose, and perceptions in a way that could generate negative perceptions and failure. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=369)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538610108}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>When people reject leadership decisions, it has a lot to do with not understanding how the process worked and not seeing bigger-picture issues. If you get in the habit of telling stories that take peers and staff (briefly!) back in time to see who, when, how, and where important decisions get made, you build trust that can serve in the inevitable situation when there is no time to explain. Someday, time limitations will force you to issue orders without explanation, and your team will infer that, like the others, your decision is based on the same diligent considerations they’ve come to know through your stories. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=377)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538610109}


---
#### Learning to Tell Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>Storytelling is as much a function of story finding as of storytelling. Sometimes you want to retell an existing story to apply a familiar context for new information. And sometimes you want to tell a new story so people can see what seems familiar in a new way. Stories can seem invisible until you get crosswise with one of them. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=400)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068592}


---
##### Story Awareness
>[!QUOTE]  
>Cultural differences help illustrate the effect of conflicting stories. At one level, that is all culture is: a collection of stories. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=404)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068594}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Cultural awareness comes from learning which stories a culture uses to interpret big questions. Story awareness is recognizing that, even within your own culture, different points of view and significant personal experiences get soaked in positive or negative emotions, so when something similar happens again (or seems to happen again), emotional reactions preemptively propel us toward or away from what our stories say will happen next. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=415)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068595}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Storytelling is also a function of your ability to find current stories at play. For instance, if you want your staff to feel they are being treated fairly, it helps to identify the stories they tell to illustrate fair/unfair behavior. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=427)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068596}


---
##### Storytelling Practice
>[!QUOTE]  
>Your goal is to tell a story that feels enough like a real experience that it stimulates an emotional response. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=449)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068598}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Rule number one to deal with the misses is to adopt the discipline of telling stories that last at most three minutes. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=452)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068599}


---
##### Where Do I Find Stories?
>[!QUOTE]  
>Winning stories feel personally significant to your listeners. The catch is, only by finding and telling stories that feel personally significant to you can you expect to elicit the level of personal engagement that wins hearts and minds. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=473)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068601}

{ #ref-539068602}

{ #ref-539068603}

{ #ref-539068604}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>1. A time you shined. This kind of story is about doing the right thing. If you are communicating a quality such as integrity, a value such as compassion, or a learning situation, these stories will tell about a time in your life when it would’ve been easier to do anything but the “right” thing. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=487)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068605}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>A time you blew it. This is about a time when something bad happened and it was all your fault. It sounds backward, but telling a story that discloses a mistake can increase trust twice as fast as polishing the story to give it a professional finish. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=491)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068606}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>A mentor. The third kind of story could be about an important person in your life or the personal impact of someone you may have never met. You are sharing an experience or a story that taught you something important in an effort to share the valuable lesson with others. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=498)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068607}

>[!QUOTE]  
>4. A book, movie, or current event. There are millions of stories from books, movies, newspaper articles, or other media sources that might just be perfect to make your point. There are even ways to make these stories personal. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=505)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068608}

##### Getting Feedback
>[!QUOTE]  
>Critical feedback improves objective skills yet can kill subjective creativity if applied too soon. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=528)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068610}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>If you are a perfectly secure, emotionally healthy person who is telling a story that does not carry any strong feelings, maybe you want a critique. But please don’t let social pressures and ridiculous phrases such as “Don’t take this personally” bully you into listening to criticism before your story is strong enough. Storytelling is personal—of course you are going to take it personally. That’s why we are doing it. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=534)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068611}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>As long as you make your living doing something other than storytelling, my advice is to ask to hear “what works.” This is based on the appreciations model developed by Doug Lipman in his book The Storytelling Coach.1 It takes more courage to ask for positive comments than it does to ask for feedback. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=540)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068612}


---
##### Training a Listener
>[!QUOTE]  
>A story is a cocreation in your mind and in the mind of at least one listener. It’s not storytelling without a listener—it’s acting, preaching, or something else. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=547)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068614}


---
#### It’s All Storytelling
>[!QUOTE]  
>The secret of becoming a good storyteller is to develop the ability to toggle back and forth between fact thinking and story thinking. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=580)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068616}

##### Lower Your Standards
>[!QUOTE]  
>Storytelling is all about the subjective details that deliver the hard-to-explain state of intuitive knowing, belief, or faith. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=602)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068618}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Making a human connection is often about telling the good and bad, the smart and stupid, as well as the generous and greedy. In fact, stories that hide all your warts aren’t very engaging, but we will get to that later. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=612)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068619}

##### Don’t Expect a Recipe to Make You a Chef
>[!QUOTE]  
>My favorite story recipe comes from traditional storyteller Donald Davis, who says that a good story has three parts: Old Normal, Something Happens, New Normal. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=630)) #✂️

{ #ref-539068623}

##### Personal Experiences Feel More Real than Facts
>[!QUOTE]  
>The fact that we had to be taught to beware of anecdotal evidence is a testament to the power of specific, tangible, firsthand experiences reported as a story. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=638)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068625}

##### The Perfect Story Can Seem Completely Irrelevant
>[!QUOTE]  
>We are getting past the mantra “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it” and learning that if you can’t measure it, you have to manage it by paying attention to the stories you tell. ([Location 678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=678)) #✂️

{ #ref-539068629}

##### Nonlinear Dynamics
>[!QUOTE]  
>Emotions are not linear. A tiny peep can deliver a strong reaction, and a day spent in meetings can create no reaction at all. Thirty slides do not equal thirty received messages. Good storytellers pay attention to the tiny details that deliver an emotional punch and often edit out important but competing issues to achieve the right emotional impact.

>When you make a presentation asking for and telling stories that address the emotions surrounding an issue, it may save you from unintended negative results.

>This is also called intimacy, and you can help establish intimacy with Who-I-Am stories—that is, telling others something about yourself so they can trust you.

When you inspire and encourage people to think for themselves, they are more actively engaged and pay better attention. However, at times, their interpretation will not be what you expected. That’s the price you pay for creative engagement. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=1076)) #✂️

#### Vision Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>A Vision story builds a sensory, imagined future, just like a bright, shiny bicycle in a store window that motivates a child to do more chores. Stimulating imagined experiences of that future bicycle fuels energy to rummage through trash for aluminum cans, to babysit little monsters, or even to wash the family car. After we see, taste, touch, smell, and hear a realistic and emotionally compelling future in our imagination, work seems less menial and difficult in relation to the payoff.

When you apply the discipline of interpreting your vision with a story, the process often exposes “plot holes” that may send you back to the drawing board.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

People mindlessly try to improve communication by increasing speed and focus. That’s great when you seek only to inform. However, when you seek to influence, speed and focus narrow the bandwidth across which you communicate. Narrow connections produce less influence.

>Listening is not something you do all the time or without end. It is a choice based on what you can process and how important it is for you to make a connection. It’s not like handing the keys to your brain over to a stranger. You are still in charge. True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories.

>When people reject leadership decisions, it has a lot to do with not understanding how the process worked and not seeing bigger-picture issues. If you get in the habit of telling stories that take peers and staff (briefly!) back in time to see who, when, how, and where important decisions get made, you build trust that can serve in the inevitable situation when there is no time to explain. Someday, time limitations will force you to issue orders without explanation, and your team will infer that, like the others, your decision is based on the same diligent considerations they’ve come to know through your stories.

>If you were going to give a one-hour presentation on your most important project and its relevance to the organization’s mission, what would it look like? Notice your mental to-do list. Does it start with time to reflect or opening PowerPoint to record a few bullet points? I know one large organization where most presentations easily include an average of 70 PowerPoint slides, called a “deck.” They spend hours formatting data and adding animation, images, and graphs. I doubt they realize the impact this presentation routine has on their thinking process. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=1974)) #✂️

Taking a stand achieves clarity, brevity, and the power of a clear, clean message. It requires that you both respect and trust your audience.

#### Storytelling by Committee
>[!QUOTE]

Retaining the ambiguity and then testing a story in a low-risk experiment is a much better way to minimize risk in storytelling.

>Choosing the right story depends equally on your group’s imagination and your group’s skill in making subjective decisions. Groups in the unfamiliar territory of images, metaphor, and emotion often seek relief by oversimplifying these immeasurable qualities and converting them into some kind of quantifiable criteria. This default to numbers doesn’t make for a better story; it just allows for an easier decision. ([Location 2053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2053)) #✂️

If a middle manager gives a report to senior management, secretly thinking they are a bunch of idiots and that his or her presentation will be futile, chances are the presentation will be futile.

>Most presentations of vital importance are between two groups that harbor secret stories that discount or discredit the other. Senior managers may think some workers join unions to exploit that power and compensate for failed careers. School teachers think the principal is really a pawn. The CEO thinks board members are already biased. There are a thousand stories out there that leave you feeling “right” but keep you from being connected.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

People mindlessly try to improve communication by increasing speed and focus. That’s great when you seek only to inform. However, when you seek to influence, speed and focus narrow the bandwidth across which you communicate. Narrow connections produce less influence.

>Listening is not something you do all the time or without end. It is a choice based on what you can process and how important it is for you to make a connection. It’s not like handing the keys to your brain over to a stranger. You are still in charge. True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories.

>Most presentations of vital importance are between two groups that harbor secret stories that discount or discredit the other. Senior managers may think some workers join unions to exploit that power and compensate for failed careers. School teachers think the principal is really a pawn. The CEO thinks board members are already biased. There are a thousand stories out there that leave you feeling “right” but keep you from being connected.

>In the same way that no person can experience life without bias, no story is without bias. A story without bias is boring because it becomes disembodied, sterilized, and dehumanized. Behavior is always based on some point of view, so own it and demonstrate that you aren’t blind to (or blinded by) your personal bias.

>Point of view alters meaning, but, more important to you, point of view also creates meaning. Choosing a time, place, and point of view from which to tell a story is what makes a story feel like a real experience. Using your story to travel through time and space can demonstrate how many equally valid points of view you see.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

>Our world moves so fast that we are pressured to make sense of incoming data as quickly as possible. Speed and focus have become unquestioned values applied to communication. People mindlessly try to improve communication by increasing speed and focus. That’s great when you seek only to inform. However, when you seek to influence, speed and focus narrow the bandwidth across which you communicate. Narrow connections produce less influence. Listening is slow and wide rather than fast and narrow. ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2271)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>Listening is not something you do all the time or without end. It is a choice based on what you can process and how important it is for you to make a connection. It’s not like handing the keys to your brain over to a stranger. You are still in charge. True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories.

### Introduction

>Zappos customer-service representatives have no scripts. Instead, they are encouraged to be creative and adapt a personalized approach to each customer and situation based on core values. Managing with stories can feel like flying without a net, but our safety nets of algorithms, policies, scripts, and rules only support the illusion that consistency translates to quality. When it comes to emotions, consistency translates to apathy. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=113)) #✂️

### Thinking in Story
#### Story Thinking
>[!QUOTE]  
>People are starving for meaningful stories, while we are surrounded by impersonal messages dressed in bells and whistles that are story-ish but no more effective than giving a mirror and bell to a starving parrot.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The Western world has spent a lot of time and energy learning how to exclude emotions from decision making, but decisions that ignore emotions are easily ignored in return.

#### Story Is Experience Reconstituted
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best you can do is bring these transformational experiences to life with a story that is so vivid, so impactful, it feels as if the listeners were actually there. For them, a story becomes a type of personal experience, even if it is experienced vicariously. This is why I define story as a reimagined experience narrated with enough detail and feeling to cause your listeners’ imaginations to experience it as real.

They pine for retirement or the firing of a certain individual (Vision), and they believe that the “haves” couldn’t care less about the “have-nots” (Value-in-Action). They unconsciously tell stories that ensure coworkers learn that no amount of effort is going to change things (Teaching) because they’ve already tried and failed (I-Know-What-You-Are-Thinking).

>When, during this typical up-and-down day, does your team experience you? When you are happy, productive, and at your best? Or when you are disappointed and frustrated? Most of us have to admit we are not that noticeable when we are happy and productive. We sort of fade into the woodwork. The times we seek attention are the times when we think a correction needs to be made. Indeed, Western culture is almost addicted to correction.

>[!QUOTE]  
>When people reject leadership decisions, it has a lot to do with not understanding how the process worked and not seeing bigger-picture issues. If you get in the habit of telling stories that take peers and staff (briefly!) back in time to see who, when, how, and where important decisions get made, you build trust that can serve in the inevitable situation when there is no time to explain. Someday, time limitations will force you to issue orders without explanation, and your team will infer that, like the others, your decision is based on the same diligent considerations they’ve come to know through your stories.

#### Learning to Tell Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>Storytelling is as much a function of story finding as of storytelling. Sometimes you want to retell an existing story to apply a familiar context for new information. And sometimes you want to tell a new story so people can see what seems familiar in a new way. Stories can seem invisible until you get crosswise with one of them.

For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

>Design engineers also use templates to describe requirements in the terms of a user story: “As a (type of user) I want (goal) so that (reason why).” While these user stories are currently very technical, notice that this template actually asks for three of the six stories addressed in this book, “Who are you? Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories. If we only hunt for stories to prove our point, it narrows our opportunities, creates blind spots, and stunts creative thinking.

## Metadata

## Highlights

### Introduction
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best storytellers learn to use their own emotional responses as divining rods to locate and tap into the emotional responses of others. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=75)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>The old rule to “know your audience” becomes a much more fertile exercise as you adopt a storytelling approach to communication. ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=96)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555065}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Zappos customer-service representatives have no scripts. Instead, they are encouraged to be creative and adapt a personalized approach to each customer and situation based on core values. Managing with stories can feel like flying without a net, but our safety nets of algorithms, policies, scripts, and rules only support the illusion that consistency translates to quality. When it comes to emotions, consistency translates to apathy. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=113)) #✂️

### Thinking in Story
#### Story Thinking
>[!QUOTE]  
>People are starving for meaningful stories, while we are surrounded by impersonal messages dressed in bells and whistles that are story-ish but no more effective than giving a mirror and bell to a starving parrot. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=155)) #✂️

##### How to S.E.E. Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>Any significant emotional event (s.e.e.) can be a story. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=168)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555072}

>[!QUOTE]  
>If the right answers were enough, everyone who needs to lose weight would only ever have to read one diet book. Behavior change requires more than knowing what to do; we have to feel like doing it. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=175)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555073}

##### What’s Important and Why
>[!QUOTE]  
>The key to story thinking is to learn which stories stimulate your own feelings first. Then find the stories that also stimulate the feelings of others. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=210)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555075}

##### Story Thinking Is Not the Opposite of Objective Thinking
##### Relax Your Internal Critic
>[!QUOTE]  
>Whatever interaction simulates a visceral, experiential sense of meaning—to the satisfaction of the listener and the teller—is a story. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=232)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555078}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>The Western world has spent a lot of time and energy learning how to exclude emotions from decision making, but decisions that ignore emotions are easily ignored in return. Story thinking doesn’t bring emotions back to decision making, but it gives us access to the emotions that have been there since the beginning of human history. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=257)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555079}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Be gentle. Stories are very powerful tools. When you activate new stories, you transport people to new points of view and change meaning and behavior, and in that way, you change the future. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=266)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555080}

#### Story Is Experience Reconstituted
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best you can do is bring these transformational experiences to life with a story that is so vivid, so impactful, it feels as if the listeners were actually there. For them, a story becomes a type of personal experience, even if it is experienced vicariously. This is why I define story as a reimagined experience narrated with enough detail and feeling to cause your listeners’ imaginations to experience it as real.

{ #ref-538555082}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Our stories help us weight data as important (or not) as well as judge the data as good or bad according to our point of view. Complexity and ambiguity are now the norm, so without proactive stories, we leave it to reactive stories to create interpretations that may or may not serve the organization. The point is that it’s to your benefit to be mindful of the stories you tell. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=295)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555083}

##### Stories We Tell Every Day
>[!QUOTE]  
>This book is actually designed to help you pay better attention to the stories you tell, so you can adjust the perceptions your stories build and sustain. Most of the time, we don’t realize we are telling stories. It is even less obvious how powerfully these stories impact our lives.

{ #ref-538555085}

##### Who-I-Am Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>What qualities earn you the right to influence a particular person? Tell of a time, place, or event that provides evidence that you have these qualities. Reveal who you are as a person. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=310)) #✂️

##### Teaching Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>Certain lessons are best learned from experience, and some lessons are learned over and over again—patience, for instance. ([Location 318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=318)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555091}


---
##### Vision Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>A worthy, exciting future story reframes present difficulties as “worth it.” Big projects and new challenges are difficult and frustrating for implementers who weren’t in on the decision. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=323)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555093}

##### Value-in-Action Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>If you want to encourage or teach a value, you have to provide a “demonstration” by telling a story that illustrates in action what that value means, behaviorally. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=330)) #✂️

{ #ref-538555097}


---
##### Choose the Stories You Tell
>[!QUOTE]  
>As mentioned before, if we were to judge people by the stories they tell on a daily basis, we would conclude most of them are stressed-out, misunderstood victims (Who-I-Am) here to survive red tape and stupid decisions (Why-I-Am-Here). They pine for retirement or the firing of a certain individual (Vision), and they believe that the “haves” couldn’t care less about the “have-nots” (Value-in-Action). They unconsciously tell stories that ensure coworkers learn that no amount of effort is going to change things (Teaching) because they’ve already tried and failed (I-Know-What-You-Are-Thinking). ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=338)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555099}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>When, during this typical up-and-down day, does your team experience you? When you are happy, productive, and at your best? Or when you are disappointed and frustrated? Most of us have to admit we are not that noticeable when we are happy and productive. We sort of fade into the woodwork. The times we seek attention are the times when we think a correction needs to be made. Indeed, Western culture is almost addicted to correction. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=362)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555100}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>It’s completely natural. Our brains are hardwired to pay more attention to problems rather than building relationships, teaching, communicating vision, daydreaming of innovations, or explaining misunderstandings. ([Location 366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=366)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555101}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>If you aren’t telling stories with intention, you may be unintentionally minimizing people’s feelings, passion, sense of purpose, and perceptions in a way that could generate negative perceptions and failure. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=369)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538610108}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>When people reject leadership decisions, it has a lot to do with not understanding how the process worked and not seeing bigger-picture issues. If you get in the habit of telling stories that take peers and staff (briefly!) back in time to see who, when, how, and where important decisions get made, you build trust that can serve in the inevitable situation when there is no time to explain. Someday, time limitations will force you to issue orders without explanation, and your team will infer that, like the others, your decision is based on the same diligent considerations they’ve come to know through your stories. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=377)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538610109}

#### Learning to Tell Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>Storytelling is as much a function of story finding as of storytelling. Sometimes you want to retell an existing story to apply a familiar context for new information. And sometimes you want to tell a new story so people can see what seems familiar in a new way. Stories can seem invisible until you get crosswise with one of them. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=400)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068592}

##### Story Awareness
>[!QUOTE]  
>Cultural differences help illustrate the effect of conflicting stories. At one level, that is all culture is: a collection of stories. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=404)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068594}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Cultural awareness comes from learning which stories a culture uses to interpret big questions. Story awareness is recognizing that, even within your own culture, different points of view and significant personal experiences get soaked in positive or negative emotions, so when something similar happens again (or seems to happen again), emotional reactions preemptively propel us toward or away from what our stories say will happen next. ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=415)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068595}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Storytelling is also a function of your ability to find current stories at play. For instance, if you want your staff to feel they are being treated fairly, it helps to identify the stories they tell to illustrate fair/unfair behavior. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=427)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068596}

##### Storytelling Practice
>[!QUOTE]  
>Your goal is to tell a story that feels enough like a real experience that it stimulates an emotional response. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=449)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068598}

>Rule number one to deal with the misses is to adopt the discipline of telling stories that last at most three minutes. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=452)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068599}


---
##### Where Do I Find Stories?
>[!QUOTE]  
>Winning stories feel personally significant to your listeners. The catch is, only by finding and telling stories that feel personally significant to you can you expect to elicit the level of personal engagement that wins hearts and minds. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=473)) #✂️

{ #ref-539068604}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>1. A time you shined. This kind of story is about doing the right thing. If you are communicating a quality such as integrity, a value such as compassion, or a learning situation, these stories will tell about a time in your life when it would’ve been easier to do anything but the “right” thing.

>[!QUOTE]  
>A time you blew it. This is about a time when something bad happened and it was all your fault. It sounds backward, but telling a story that discloses a mistake can increase trust twice as fast as polishing the story to give it a professional finish.

{ #ref-539068606}

There are even ways to make these stories personal. ([Location 505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=505)) #✂️

##### Getting Feedback
>[!QUOTE]  
>Critical feedback improves objective skills yet can kill subjective creativity if applied too soon. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=528)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068610}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>If you are a perfectly secure, emotionally healthy person who is telling a story that does not carry any strong feelings, maybe you want a critique. But please don’t let social pressures and ridiculous phrases such as “Don’t take this personally” bully you into listening to criticism before your story is strong enough. Storytelling is personal—of course you are going to take it personally. That’s why we are doing it. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=534)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068611}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>As long as you make your living doing something other than storytelling, my advice is to ask to hear “what works.” This is based on the appreciations model developed by Doug Lipman in his book The Storytelling Coach.1 It takes more courage to ask for positive comments than it does to ask for feedback.

{ #ref-539068612}

##### Training a Listener
>[!QUOTE]  
>A story is a cocreation in your mind and in the mind of at least one listener. It’s not storytelling without a listener—it’s acting, preaching, or something else. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=547)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068614}

##### Nonlinear Dynamics
>[!QUOTE]  
>Emotions are not linear. A tiny peep can deliver a strong reaction, and a day spent in meetings can create no reaction at all. Thirty slides do not equal thirty received messages.

#### Teaching Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>AT ITS BEST, a Teaching story transports listeners into an experience that empowers them to emotionally feel as well as hear, see, taste, touch, and smell an excellent performance or the unforgettable consequences of a poor performance. It demonstrates how new behaviors create new results. It is a no-risk demonstration: a trial by imagination.

>One caveat for using stories to teach: remember, it only works about 70 percent of the time. When you inspire and encourage people to think for themselves, they are more actively engaged and pay better attention. However, at times, their interpretation will not be what you expected. That’s the price you pay for creative engagement. ([Location 1076](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=1076)) #✂️

#### Vision Stories
>[!QUOTE]

Stimulating imagined experiences of that future bicycle fuels energy to rummage through trash for aluminum cans, to babysit little monsters, or even to wash the family car. After we see, taste, touch, smell, and hear a realistic and emotionally compelling future in our imagination, work seems less menial and difficult in relation to the payoff.

>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

However, when you seek to influence, speed and focus narrow the bandwidth across which you communicate. Narrow connections produce less influence.

It’s not like handing the keys to your brain over to a stranger. You are still in charge. True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories.

#### The Gift of Brevity
>[!QUOTE]  
>What does this have to do with brevity? The ambivalence of wanting to appear sympathetic and wanting to give someone a kick in the butt can trap you in a looping conversation. These loops cycle endlessly as new ideas are met with a “yes, but” rejection followed by sympathy, which elicits more examples of feeling trapped, which trigger new ideas for change, and you are back to “yes, but.” It’s an infinite loop that you can focus like a laser once you are willing to choose one value over another.

Does it start with time to reflect or opening PowerPoint to record a few bullet points? I know one large organization where most presentations easily include an average of 70 PowerPoint slides, called a “deck.” They spend hours formatting data and adding animation, images, and graphs. I doubt they realize the impact this presentation routine has on their thinking process. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=1974)) #✂️

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

People mindlessly try to improve communication by increasing speed and focus. That’s great when you seek only to inform. However, when you seek to influence, speed and focus narrow the bandwidth across which you communicate. Narrow connections produce less influence. Listening is slow and wide rather than fast and narrow. ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2271)) #✂️

>Listening is not something you do all the time or without end. It is a choice based on what you can process and how important it is for you to make a connection. It’s not like handing the keys to your brain over to a stranger. You are still in charge. True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories.

>In her book On Becoming an Artist, Ellen Langer cites research into the “illusion of control” as she ruthlessly deconstructs our favorite habits of using set principles and cognitive frames to improve decisions.9 Particularly in business, routines that make decisions easier may sacrifice the engaging messiness of human experience. The better we get at acting like automatons, the less meaningful our stories become. ([Location 2062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2062)) #✂️

#### Point of View
>[!QUOTE]  
>Tone, facial expressions, and body language will always give away the story you are telling yourself about your audience. If a middle manager gives a report to senior management, secretly thinking they are a bunch of idiots and that his or her presentation will be futile, chances are the presentation will be futile. These nonverbal communications may never reach the presenter’s or senior management’s awareness, but negative feelings distort interpretations.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Most presentations of vital importance are between two groups that harbor secret stories that discount or discredit the other. Senior managers may think some workers join unions to exploit that power and compensate for failed careers. School teachers think the principal is really a pawn. The CEO thinks board members are already biased. There are a thousand stories out there that leave you feeling “right” but keep you from being connected.

>[!QUOTE]  
>In the same way that no person can experience life without bias, no story is without bias. A story without bias is boring because it becomes disembodied, sterilized, and dehumanized. Behavior is always based on some point of view, so own it and demonstrate that you aren’t blind to (or blinded by) your personal bias.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Point of view alters meaning, but, more important to you, point of view also creates meaning. Choosing a time, place, and point of view from which to tell a story is what makes a story feel like a real experience. Using your story to travel through time and space can demonstrate how many equally valid points of view you see.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Our world moves so fast that we are pressured to make sense of incoming data as quickly as possible. Speed and focus have become unquestioned values applied to communication. People mindlessly try to improve communication by increasing speed and focus. That’s great when you seek only to inform. However, when you seek to influence, speed and focus narrow the bandwidth across which you communicate. Narrow connections produce less influence. Listening is slow and wide rather than fast and narrow. ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2271)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>Listening is not something you do all the time or without end. It is a choice based on what you can process and how important it is for you to make a connection. It’s not like handing the keys to your brain over to a stranger. You are still in charge. True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

One time, I heard someone complain that her story was boring, so I automatically replied, “Then you need to tell the truth.” She responded, “Do you mean the part when I had an affair with the minister?” That certainly didn’t sound very boring to me.

Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories. If we only hunt for stories to prove our point, it narrows our opportunities, creates blind spots, and stunts creative thinking.

### Introduction
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best storytellers learn to use their own emotional responses as divining rods to locate and tap into the emotional responses of others. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=75)) #✂️

>Zappos customer-service representatives have no scripts. Instead, they are encouraged to be creative and adapt a personalized approach to each customer and situation based on core values. Managing with stories can feel like flying without a net, but our safety nets of algorithms, policies, scripts, and rules only support the illusion that consistency translates to quality. When it comes to emotions, consistency translates to apathy. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=113)) #✂️

### Thinking in Story
#### Story Thinking
>[!QUOTE]  
>People are starving for meaningful stories, while we are surrounded by impersonal messages dressed in bells and whistles that are story-ish but no more effective than giving a mirror and bell to a starving parrot.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The Western world has spent a lot of time and energy learning how to exclude emotions from decision making, but decisions that ignore emotions are easily ignored in return.

#### Story Is Experience Reconstituted
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best you can do is bring these transformational experiences to life with a story that is so vivid, so impactful, it feels as if the listeners were actually there. For them, a story becomes a type of personal experience, even if it is experienced vicariously. This is why I define story as a reimagined experience narrated with enough detail and feeling to cause your listeners’ imaginations to experience it as real.

They pine for retirement or the firing of a certain individual (Vision), and they believe that the “haves” couldn’t care less about the “have-nots” (Value-in-Action). They unconsciously tell stories that ensure coworkers learn that no amount of effort is going to change things (Teaching) because they’ve already tried and failed (I-Know-What-You-Are-Thinking).

Most of us have to admit we are not that noticeable when we are happy and productive. We sort of fade into the woodwork. The times we seek attention are the times when we think a correction needs to be made. Indeed, Western culture is almost addicted to correction.

>[!QUOTE]  
>When people reject leadership decisions, it has a lot to do with not understanding how the process worked and not seeing bigger-picture issues. If you get in the habit of telling stories that take peers and staff (briefly!) back in time to see who, when, how, and where important decisions get made, you build trust that can serve in the inevitable situation when there is no time to explain. Someday, time limitations will force you to issue orders without explanation, and your team will infer that, like the others, your decision is based on the same diligent considerations they’ve come to know through your stories.

#### Learning to Tell Stories
>[!QUOTE]

For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

>If you don’t have a high tolerance for imperfection, people will shy away from telling you the “whole story.” And it’s common wisdom that the rest of the story is where you find the most interesting bits. One time, I heard someone complain that her story was boring, so I automatically replied, “Then you need to tell the truth.” She responded, “Do you mean the part when I had an affair with the minister?” That certainly didn’t sound very boring to me.

>Design engineers also use templates to describe requirements in the terms of a user story: “As a (type of user) I want (goal) so that (reason why).” While these user stories are currently very technical, notice that this template actually asks for three of the six stories addressed in this book, “Who are you? Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories. If we only hunt for stories to prove our point, it narrows our opportunities, creates blind spots, and stunts creative thinking.

### Introduction
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best storytellers learn to use their own emotional responses as divining rods to locate and tap into the emotional responses of others. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=75)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>Zappos customer-service representatives have no scripts. Instead, they are encouraged to be creative and adapt a personalized approach to each customer and situation based on core values. Managing with stories can feel like flying without a net, but our safety nets of algorithms, policies, scripts, and rules only support the illusion that consistency translates to quality. When it comes to emotions, consistency translates to apathy. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=113)) #✂️

### Thinking in Story
#### Story Thinking
>[!QUOTE]  
>People are starving for meaningful stories, while we are surrounded by impersonal messages dressed in bells and whistles that are story-ish but no more effective than giving a mirror and bell to a starving parrot.

##### What’s Important and Why
>[!QUOTE]  
>The key to story thinking is to learn which stories stimulate your own feelings first. Then find the stories that also stimulate the feelings of others. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=210)) #✂️

##### Story Thinking Is Not the Opposite of Objective Thinking
##### Relax Your Internal Critic
>[!QUOTE]  
>Whatever interaction simulates a visceral, experiential sense of meaning—to the satisfaction of the listener and the teller—is a story. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=232)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-538555078}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>The Western world has spent a lot of time and energy learning how to exclude emotions from decision making, but decisions that ignore emotions are easily ignored in return. Story thinking doesn’t bring emotions back to decision making, but it gives us access to the emotions that have been there since the beginning of human history.

>Be gentle. Stories are very powerful tools. When you activate new stories, you transport people to new points of view and change meaning and behavior, and in that way, you change the future. ([Location 266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=266)) #✂️

#### Story Is Experience Reconstituted
>[!QUOTE]  
>The best you can do is bring these transformational experiences to life with a story that is so vivid, so impactful, it feels as if the listeners were actually there. For them, a story becomes a type of personal experience, even if it is experienced vicariously. This is why I define story as a reimagined experience narrated with enough detail and feeling to cause your listeners’ imaginations to experience it as real.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Our stories help us weight data as important (or not) as well as judge the data as good or bad according to our point of view. Complexity and ambiguity are now the norm, so without proactive stories, we leave it to reactive stories to create interpretations that may or may not serve the organization. The point is that it’s to your benefit to be mindful of the stories you tell. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=295)) #✂️

##### Stories We Tell Every Day
>[!QUOTE]  
>This book is actually designed to help you pay better attention to the stories you tell, so you can adjust the perceptions your stories build and sustain. Most of the time, we don’t realize we are telling stories. It is even less obvious how powerfully these stories impact our lives.

{ #ref-538555091}

##### Choose the Stories You Tell
>[!QUOTE]  
>As mentioned before, if we were to judge people by the stories they tell on a daily basis, we would conclude most of them are stressed-out, misunderstood victims (Who-I-Am) here to survive red tape and stupid decisions (Why-I-Am-Here). They pine for retirement or the firing of a certain individual (Vision), and they believe that the “haves” couldn’t care less about the “have-nots” (Value-in-Action). They unconsciously tell stories that ensure coworkers learn that no amount of effort is going to change things (Teaching) because they’ve already tried and failed (I-Know-What-You-Are-Thinking).

---
>[!QUOTE]  
>When, during this typical up-and-down day, does your team experience you? When you are happy, productive, and at your best? Or when you are disappointed and frustrated? Most of us have to admit we are not that noticeable when we are happy and productive. We sort of fade into the woodwork. The times we seek attention are the times when we think a correction needs to be made. Indeed, Western culture is almost addicted to correction.

{ #ref-538555100}

Our brains are hardwired to pay more attention to problems rather than building relationships, teaching, communicating vision, daydreaming of innovations, or explaining misunderstandings.

{ #ref-538555101}

{ #ref-538610108}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>When people reject leadership decisions, it has a lot to do with not understanding how the process worked and not seeing bigger-picture issues. If you get in the habit of telling stories that take peers and staff (briefly!) back in time to see who, when, how, and where important decisions get made, you build trust that can serve in the inevitable situation when there is no time to explain. Someday, time limitations will force you to issue orders without explanation, and your team will infer that, like the others, your decision is based on the same diligent considerations they’ve come to know through your stories.

#### Learning to Tell Stories
>[!QUOTE]  
>Storytelling is as much a function of story finding as of storytelling. Sometimes you want to retell an existing story to apply a familiar context for new information. And sometimes you want to tell a new story so people can see what seems familiar in a new way. Stories can seem invisible until you get crosswise with one of them.

{ #ref-539068594}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Cultural awareness comes from learning which stories a culture uses to interpret big questions. Story awareness is recognizing that, even within your own culture, different points of view and significant personal experiences get soaked in positive or negative emotions, so when something similar happens again (or seems to happen again), emotional reactions preemptively propel us toward or away from what our stories say will happen next.

{ #ref-539068595}


---
>[!QUOTE]  
>Storytelling is also a function of your ability to find current stories at play. For instance, if you want your staff to feel they are being treated fairly, it helps to identify the stories they tell to illustrate fair/unfair behavior.

##### Where Do I Find Stories?
>[!QUOTE]  
>Winning stories feel personally significant to your listeners. The catch is, only by finding and telling stories that feel personally significant to you can you expect to elicit the level of personal engagement that wins hearts and minds.

>[!QUOTE]  
>1. A time you shined. This kind of story is about doing the right thing.

>If you are a perfectly secure, emotionally healthy person who is telling a story that does not carry any strong feelings, maybe you want a critique. But please don’t let social pressures and ridiculous phrases such as “Don’t take this personally” bully you into listening to criticism before your story is strong enough. Storytelling is personal—of course you are going to take it personally. That’s why we are doing it. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=534)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-539068611}

>[!QUOTE]  
>As long as you make your living doing something other than storytelling, my advice is to ask to hear “what works.” This is based on the appreciations model developed by Doug Lipman in his book The Storytelling Coach.1 It takes more courage to ask for positive comments than it does to ask for feedback.

##### Training a Listener
>[!QUOTE]  
>A story is a cocreation in your mind and in the mind of at least one listener. It’s not storytelling without a listener—it’s acting, preaching, or something else. ([Location 547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=547)) #✂️

It demonstrates how new behaviors create new results. It is a no-risk demonstration: a trial by imagination.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

It’s not like handing the keys to your brain over to a stranger. You are still in charge. True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories.

#### The Gift of Brevity
>[!QUOTE]  
>What does this have to do with brevity? The ambivalence of wanting to appear sympathetic and wanting to give someone a kick in the butt can trap you in a looping conversation. These loops cycle endlessly as new ideas are met with a “yes, but” rejection followed by sympathy, which elicits more examples of feeling trapped, which trigger new ideas for change, and you are back to “yes, but.” It’s an infinite loop that you can focus like a laser once you are willing to choose one value over another.

#### Story Listening
>[!QUOTE]  
>Before you make another presentation about a future project, I recommend you stop and listen to the stories that are operating right now in your mind and in your audience’s minds. This process feels awkward. Asking coworkers out of the blue, “Tell me a story about hope,” is a bit weird. It’s better if you lay some groundwork. Give them a reasonable basis for the question. For example, say, “I’m trying to get a fix on how we approach projects, and I need your help. This doesn’t have to apply to your job, but how would you characterize our willingness to risk in pursuit of extraordinary outcomes?” Be prepared to stay silent when they give you strange looks. Steer them away from hypothetical or existential discussions. Keep asking for a concrete example. Ask them for a story. If necessary, tell your own story about a recent or important experience of hope or hopelessness. Don’t force your story or theirs to move in the direction you would prefer—that will give you a false reading. Don’t try to craft the story in any way. This is a process of mapping the mental terrain. You don’t draw maps based on where you wish the mountains were. Useful maps show where the mountains actually are.

People mindlessly try to improve communication by increasing speed and focus. That’s great when you seek only to inform. However, when you seek to influence, speed and focus narrow the bandwidth across which you communicate. Narrow connections produce less influence. Listening is slow and wide rather than fast and narrow. ([Location 2271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2271)) #✂️

>Listening is not something you do all the time or without end. It is a choice based on what you can process and how important it is for you to make a connection. It’s not like handing the keys to your brain over to a stranger. You are still in charge. True, genuine listening feels risky when time is short, but you don’t abdicate decision making just because you slow down long enough to imagine another person’s experiences. Listening may take you to a place you don’t want to go. Listening may reveal trouble about which you were blissfully ignorant. Still, listening always makes you smarter and earns you stronger connections to work with and through. ([Location 2301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00TRF2QV0&location=2301)) #✂️

Why are you here? What is your vision?” The format demands we temporarily set our agendas aside in order to truly understand stories as personal as Who-I-Am, Why-I-Am-Here, and Vision stories. If we only hunt for stories to prove our point, it narrows our opportunities, creates blind spots, and stunts creative thinking.
