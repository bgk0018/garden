### THE FUNDAMENTALS Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference
#### 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
>[!QUOTE]  
>Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=252)) #✂️ 
{ #ref-518217613}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

#### 2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=441)) #✂️

{ #ref-518217640}

It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=480)) #✂️

#### 3 How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

{ #ref-518217662}

>[!QUOTE]  
>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential.

>Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=670)) #✂️

>Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=679)) #✂️

Our responses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness.

#### 19 The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
>[!QUOTE]  
>The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.

#### 20 The Downside of Creating Good Habits
>[!QUOTE]  
>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—not improving them.
