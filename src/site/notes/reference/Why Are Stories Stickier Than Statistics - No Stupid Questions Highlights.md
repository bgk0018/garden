## Highlights

>[!QUOTE]  
>Stories Resonate, Rules Fade
>Summary:
>Human memory thrives on narratives rather than mere statistics or rules.
>Institutions aiming to promote ethical behavior find greater success not in presenting rules, but in sharing compelling stories. Research highlights that storytelling engages audiences far better than simply citing regulations.
>An example from the U.S. Department of Defense illustrates this: instead of relaying dry rules, a lawyer created a collection of real-life ethical failures that caught attention and conveyed messages more effectively.
>This approach underlines the power of storytelling in influencing behavior and ensuring messages stick.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 2
>So human memory clearly has power. Now, the Ten Commandments, of course, are not statistics, right? I'm not saying that this question was only about stories versus statistics, but it does make the point, I guess that stories are sticky.
>Speaker 1
>Yeah, so the Ten Commandments are not statistics, but you know, it calls to mind something like let's say you're an institution a government a family and you're trying to tell people Why they should do the right thing? I mean look there's a ton of research from your field that shows that telling them to do the right thing often doesn't work. But there's also research that shows that telling them the rule itself is much less effective than telling them a story. So a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Defense here is a guy named Steve Epstein. His job was to brief supervisors in different government departments on the kind of things that their employees should and should not be doing. And he found that if he would tell them the rules and regs, that people would read it and their eyes would glaze over. So instead, he created this book of true stories that he called the Encyclopedia of Ethical Failure. And it was nothing but a catalog of epic screw-ups perpetrated by federal workers, and his claim was that it was much more successful. You've mentioned something on the show before about the identifiable victim effect, yes? ([Time 0:06:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/35504dbf-21cd-4a02-8c6e-5840cc5fa821)) #✂️
