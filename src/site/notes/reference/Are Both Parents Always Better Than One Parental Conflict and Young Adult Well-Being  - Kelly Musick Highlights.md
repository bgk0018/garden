# Are Both Parents Always Better Than One? Parental Conflict and Young Adult Well-Being *

![cover|150](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/corehtml/pmc/pmcgifs/pmc-card-share.jpg?_=0)
## Metadata
- Document Note: Growing up without both parents or in high conflict married-parent families may lead to poorer outcomes for children compared to those in low conflict continuously married-parent families. Parental conflict and family structure play important roles in young adult well-being, with income and parenting practices influencing child outcomes across different family types. Understanding the impact of conflict and family structure is crucial for researchers studying child well-being.

>Using data from three waves of the National Survey of Families and Households (N=1,963), we examine associations between adolescent family experiences and young adult well-being across a range of indicators, including schooling, substance use, and family-related transitions. We compare children living with both biological parents, but whose parents differ in how often they argue, to children in stepfather and single-mother families, and we assess the extent to which differences can be understood in terms of family income and parenting practices. Findings suggest that parental conflict is associated with children’s poorer academic achievement, increased substance use, and early family formation and dissolution.

>Children whose parents often argue score worse on measures of academic achievement, behavior problems, psychological well-being, and adult relationship quality; they are also more likely to form families early and outside of marriage ([Amato & Sobolewski, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R9); [Booth & Amato, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R18); [Booth & Edwards, 1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R19); [Davies & Cummings, 1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R32); [Emery, 1982](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R39); [Furstenberg & Teitler, 1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R42); [Grych & Fincham, 1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R46); [Hanson, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R47); [Jekielek, 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R52); [Morrison & Coiro, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R64); [Musick & Bumpass, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R65)). Examining variation in conflict between married parents is important for social scientists because it expands our understanding of how families matter for children.

We provide a broad descriptive portrait of family structure, parental conflict, and child well-being, bringing together literatures on family structure and marital conflict.

We focus on the family environment during children’s adolescence, include a range of young adult outcomes, and investigate key explanations for links between the two.

>There are also compelling theoretical reasons to expect family structure and conflict effects on children. Family income and parenting practices, in particular, are two causal pathways that have been discussed extensively in the family structure literature. While estimates vary on how much is due to selection and how much is due to family structure, single-parent families are at much higher risk of poverty than other family types ([Duncan & Rodgers, 1991](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R36); [Eggebeen & Lichter, 1991](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R38); [McLanahan & Percheski, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R60); [Thomas & Sawhill, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R83)), which in turn is linked to child health and well-being.

>In sum, we expect that parental conflict and family structure will be associated with young adult well-being, and that parenting and income will account for these associations to varying degrees. For example, in the case of academic achievement, associations may run indirectly through time with mothers; but in the case of union dissolution, associations may be more directly linked to parental conflict and family structure.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The present study extends the literature on family structure, which generally means how parents’ marital and cohabiting histories sort children into single, step, and two biological-parent families, by highlighting diversity in the family experiences of children living with continuously married parents. We build conflict into our analysis, adding another family type – high conflict continuously married-parent families – to traditional measures of family structure. Drawing attention to conflict as an important family factor in and of itself, we shift the emphasis of the demographic literature on parental conflict, which tends to focus on conflict as a selection or conditioning variable in the divorce process. We extend research both on family structure and conflict by examining the roles played by income and parenting in accounting for differences in the young adult well-being of children from single, step, and high conflict continuously married-parent families.

>More generally, observing family experiences at a single point in time, as we do, may result in an underestimate of the association between parental conflict and child well-being, relative to other family types. That is, we will underestimate parental conflict to the extent that young adults in other family types experienced it at some point in time, but not when it was assessed in the NSFH. Unmeasured conflict will be captured in lower levels of child well-being, blurring distinctions between the high and low conflict married-parent family types and inflating associations between step and single-parent families, relative to our high conflict married-parent families.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#FN3) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01httrcgnxpkbawdjchpjh5xzw)) #✂️ #👻 ai highlighted

>We restrict our analyses to children who were living with their biological mother at NSFH1, thereby excluding single father and stepmother families, which are relatively rare and cannot be analyzed separately. We also exclude cases who experienced the death of a parent as there are too few deaths to analyze separately, and the processes of divorce and death affect children differently ([Biblarz & Gottainer, 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#R15)). Finally, we lose a small number of cases due to missing values on parental conflict and union transitions, child outcomes, and family background characteristics.

>We measure conflict between continuously married parents on the basis of couples’ responses to six items concerning frequency of conflict. Main respondents and their spouses/partners were asked: “The following is a list of subjects on which couples often have disagreements. How often, if at all, in the last year have you had open disagreements about each of the following…” The subjects include household tasks, money, spending time together, sex, in-laws, and the children. We generate a conflict scale by averaging all valid responses from mothers and fathers to these six items, keeping observations on conflict when only one parent report is available.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/#FN7) This measure has good scale reliability (Chronbach’s alpha = 0.81).

>[Table 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/table/T1/) shows means and standard deviations of our income and mothering variables for our full sample and by family type. Differences across family types suggest that these variables may indeed account for associations between family structure, conflict, and child outcomes. While family income varies somewhat by level of marital conflict, variation within continuously married-parent families is small relative to the very large gap between them and single mothers (e.g., nearly $58,000 for high conflict continuously married parents compared to $27,000 for single mothers).

>Whether we focus on Model 1 or 2, differences *are* statistically significant in the case of early cohabitation, with the risk being about 30% lower for children from high conflict married-parent families, relative to those from either stepfather or single-mother families. But differences among these families are not statistically significant in the case of early sex, and the picture is mixed when we look at nonmarital childbearing (in Model 2, no significant differences) and union dissolution (in Model 2, higher risks among children from single-mother families, relative to both high conflict and stepfather families).

>We set out to address how children who experience high levels of parental conflict fare compared to those in other family arrangements. Our results clearly illustrate that the advantages of living with two continuously married parents are not shared equally by all children. In models unadjusted for income and parenting, children from high conflict married-parent families (compared to low conflict married-parent families) had higher odds (ranging from about 50–75%) of dropping out of high school, reporting poor grades, smoking, and binge drinking; they were at greater risk (on the order of about 50%) of early sex, nonmarital childbearing, and union dissolution.
