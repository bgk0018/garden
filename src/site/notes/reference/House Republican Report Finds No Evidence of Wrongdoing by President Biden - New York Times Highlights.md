## Highlights

>[!QUOTE]  
>But on Wednesday, the Republicans conceded that they had yet to find evidence of a specific corrupt action Mr. Biden took in office in connection with any of the business deals his son entered into. Instead, their presentation underscored how little headway top G.O.P. lawmakers have made in finding clear evidence of questionable transactions they can tie to Mr. Biden, their chief political rival.

>[!QUOTE]  
>None of the payments detailed in the report went to President Biden himself, nor has Mr. Comer’s investigation produced any evidence that Mr. Biden ever took a corrupt action in connection with his son’s business dealings.
>But Mr. Biden has made several false or misleading statements about the matter.
>During the 2020 presidential debate, Mr. Biden claimed that no one in his family had received money from China.
>“My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about, China,” Mr. Biden said, turning the charge on his opponent, President Donald J. Trump. “The only guy who made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.”
>This year, Mr. Biden also claimed that it was “not true” that family members received more than $1 million from a Chinese firm.
>Aides to Mr. Biden said he was speaking colloquially and was pushing back generally on claims that his administration had been corrupted by Chinese money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h05bx0mybjmwmwf3dghh7a0e)) #✂️
