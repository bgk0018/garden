## Highlights
#📫
>[!QUOTE]  
>A **progress clock** is a circle divided into segments (see examples at right). Draw a progress clock when you need to track ongoing effort against an obstacle or the approach of impending trouble. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bsmkatcka5xgvbrbhejqcr)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>When you create a clock, make it about the **obstacle,** not the method. The clocks for an infiltration should be “Interior Patrols” and “The Tower,” not “Sneak Past the Guards” or “Climb the Tower.” The patrols and the tower are the obstacles—the PCs can attempt to overcome them in a variety of ways.
