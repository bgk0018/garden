## Metadata
- Document Note: The paper "Getting Things Done" discusses David Allen's personal productivity enhancement method for dealing with information overload. The authors argue that recent insights in psychology and cognitive science support and extend GTD's recommendations. They review theories of situated, embodied, and distributed cognition that explain how the brain processes information and plans actions in the real world. The paper shows how these principles are practically implemented in GTD, with its focus on organizing tasks into "actionable" external memories and opportunistic, situation-dependent execution. Finally, the authors propose an extension of GTD to support collaborative work, inspired by the concept of stigmergy.

>Allen distinguishes five basic stages in our work:
>We (1) *collect* things that command our attention; (2) *process* what they mean and what to do with them; and
>(3) *organize* the results, which we (4) *review* as options for what we choose to (5) *do*. (Allen, 2001, 24) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9z3awptbasq0mds5k5g28e)) #✂️

>The first phase is to collect *everything* that catches your attention as potentially relevant to your activities, whatever its subject, importance or degree of urgency. This includes incoming letters, emails, phone calls, reports, articles from magazines, agenda items, suggestions and requests from other people, and personal ideas and memories. For the collecting process, you need one or more *collection tools*, which can be physical (trays, folders, notebook, etc.), or electronic (email application, outliner, or word processor, on a computer or a PDA). These together define your “in-basket”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9z3y6q70jz4bc3qprwap40)) #✂️

>What is the next physical action?”
>• if there is more than one action required, store it in your **Projects** list.
>• if the action requires less than two minutes, it is not worth the effort of entering it into the system: better perform it immediately.
>• if you are not the best person to do it, delegate the action to a more qualified
>person/organization, and keep track of whether you get back the desired result by entering a note in the **Waiting for** file.
>• if the action is to be done on a particular day and time, defer it to this moment,
>and note it on your **Calendar**.
>• if the only time constraint is that you should do it as soon as you can, put it in your **Next actions** file. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9z9wvx52scywnxne6bw53g)) #✂️
