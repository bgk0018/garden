>[!QUOTE]  
>Focus on One Task at a Time
>Summary:
>Study after study shows that multitasking or task switching leads to lower quality work, increased time taken to complete tasks, and more mistakes.
>It is more efficient to complete one task before moving on to the next, rather than trying to work on multiple tasks simultaneously, which can take up to double the time or more.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 2
>Eventual, hopefully coming soon-ish ADHD episode, we've already got the stuff kind of cold, but it's a lot. It's a big episode. So I know people have been asking for it for a long time. So anyway, that's coming down the pike. But one thing that we have roundly seen in study after study is when you try to multitask or task switch back and forth is that your work suffers. Not only are you taking longer to get things done than you would if you did it sequentially, and by sequentially we mean completing a task and then moving on to the next. Not only are you taking more time when you think you're not, you think you're actually being more efficient maybe, if you're living a lie, like most of us are, but you're actually doing Less, the work is less good and you're making more mistakes along the way as well.

>Yeah, did you say that it can take up to double the time or more? No. Yeah, when you try to multitask, let's say you're doing your test with making a paper airplane and then shaving a bunny. If you try to do those two things at the same time, it will actually take sometimes twice as long when you try to do them at the same time, then it will if you make the paper ([Time 0:23:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a84287fd-b381-4c9a-98cd-80b5f45a0604)) #✂️
