## Highlights

### Don’t estimate
>[!QUOTE]  
>One of my favourite principles from the agile manifesto is “people over process” - this means people need to be able to make decisions on how they work. As the people who do the work, will best know how to do it.
>Allen illustrated this with a story where the Toyota process (lean principles) was used to turn around a GM car manufacturing plant in the US. Within half a year it went from a worst performer to a best performer. Then General Motors had everyone document their processes and dumped it to a different plant, where (no surprise there) it failed spectacularly. A process that works in one context can’t just be transplated. The same applies for Scrum. Allen noted that he thought that when Ken Schwaber came up with Scrum 20 years ago it probably worked brilliantly in that setting. But it is not something that can just be blindly replicated and just assumed as gospel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf4p8pbkf67bgdgvwqbacw37)) #✂️
