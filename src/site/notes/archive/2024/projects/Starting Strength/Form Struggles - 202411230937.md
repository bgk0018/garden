# Form Struggles

I think it's unlikely I'm going to listen through the entire starting strength book at this time. I'm struggling to follow along in the car and I don't see it as a book I'm likely to dive deep into myself.

Instead, what I think is going to be a better approach is to listen to the coaches cues and think about what areas I'm struggling in with regards to Starting Strength.

I think my current weaknesses are:

- Squat
	- Getting my chest parallel to the ground in the squat early enough and delaying raising my chest until the last moment
	- Thinking about driving up with my hips
- Press
	- Using my abs and quads to drive the bar up over my head with the initial 'bounce' instead of my back
- Deadlift
	- Keeping my hamstrings tight at the bottom of the Deadlift
	- Clearing the bar of my knees
