# Welcome!

Glad you stopped by. I intend for this to be my main conduit for learning in public. I intend of publishing here my media highlights, findings, musings, and things I'm working on.

## What is This?

These are markdown files I publish from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault using [Digital Garden Docs](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/roadmap/).

## How Do I Use This?

You can start literally anywhere but here's a table of interesting entry points:

| Link                             | Description                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[blog/Articles\|Articles]]                     | A list of articles I've written based on subjects I'm interested in |
| [[blog/Maps of Content\|Maps of Content]]              | Entry points into different subjects I've thought and researched on |
| [[blog/Highlights\|Media Highlights]] | Highlights of source material I've clipped over time, mostly books  |
