# Welcome!

Glad you stopped by. I intend for this to be my main conduit for learning in public. I intend of publishing here my media highlights, findings, musings, and things I'm working on.

## What is this?

These are markdown files I publish from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault using [Digital Garden Docs](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/roadmap/).

## How do I use this?

On the left, you should see a few folders.

| Folder | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `/articles` | Basic articles in chronological order I have written for this space |
| `/permanent` | Evergreen notes, zettlekasten adjacent notes, highlights, and other resources I will surface |
| `/reference` | Some useful references for understanding the meta data sprinkled throughout this website |
| `Home` | You're here now |

You can start literally anywhere but here's a table of interesting entry points:
