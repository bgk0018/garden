# Welcome!

Glad you stopped by. I intend for this to be my main conduit for learning in public. I intend of publishing here my media highlights, findings, musings, and things I'm working on.

## What is This?

These are markdown files I publish from my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault using [Digital Garden Docs](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/roadmap/).

## How Do I Use This?

You can start literally anywhere but here's a table of interesting entry points:

- [[blog/Highlights\|Media Highlights]]
- [[blog/Maps of Content\|Maps of Content]]
