# Maps of Content

A Map of Content (MOC) serves as a navigational hub in your digital notes. Like a map helps you navigate physical terrain, an MOC helps you navigate your knowledge landscape by:

- Providing an overview of a topic area
- Creating meaningful connections between related notes
- Offering multiple entry points to explore your knowledge
- Making it easier to find and maintain context
