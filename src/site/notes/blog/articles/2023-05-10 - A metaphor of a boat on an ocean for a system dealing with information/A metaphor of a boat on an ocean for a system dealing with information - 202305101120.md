# Content

One of the things I learned from [[references/Atomic Habits - James Clear\|Atomic Habits]] that I really like was the quote of:

The reason why I like this quote is several fold, systems are just better at keeping track of all of the details you have to juggle. That's their whole point of existence is to manage it all. Without a system it's you treading the huge ocean of information you live in every day. I'd rather have something I've built to help buoy me throughout the day and make sure I can stay above water. This system helps me by providing space for the work I need to get done and carries the pieces I can't get to until later. It also keeps those pieces close as opposed to them drifting off into the distance with every new wave being thrown at you.
