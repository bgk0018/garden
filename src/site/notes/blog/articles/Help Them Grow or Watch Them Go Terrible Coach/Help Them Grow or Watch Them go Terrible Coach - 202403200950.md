# Help Them Grow or Watch Them Go Terrible Coach

[[reference/Brene Brown\|Brene Brown]] talks about you often have to spend way more time researching the things that get in the way of what you are after (Dare to Lead is about courage, and mostly about fear) 

1. Come up with a persona who does everything in their power to violate your principle as laid out in [[archive/2023/projects/HaloMD Technical Assessment V2/Help Them Grow Or Watch Them Go - Beverly Kaye Julie Winkle Giulioni\|Help Them Grow Or Watch Them Go]]
	1. List out the common actions they'd take
	2. List out how they may justify their actions
	3. What are the outcomes they're looking for?
	4. If you were this person's career coachee/mentee, what feedback might you give? 
	5. What's one small thing they could change?

**Opposite of Pull vs. Push**: *Example*: Instead of empowering employees to take ownership of their career development, a manager, Alex, dictates their career paths based on organizational needs or personal preferences. He pushes employees into roles or assignments without considering their interests or readiness

1. **Proactivity**: Encourage managers (and coaches) to take a proactive approach to career development by initiating conversations with employees about their career aspirations, goals, and development needs. Waiting for employees to raise career-related concerns may result in missed opportunities for growth.
    
2. **Partnership**: Advocate for a partnership-based approach to career development, where managers and employees work collaboratively to identify and pursue career goals. This involves active listening, empathy, and mutual respect between managers and employees.
    
3. **Personalization**: Recognize that each employee has unique career aspirations, interests, and strengths. Effective career development strategies are tailored to the individual needs and preferences of each employee rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach.
    
4. **Possibility Thinking**: Encourage managers (and coaches) to adopt a mindset of possibility thinking when supporting employees' career development. This involves helping employees explore a wide range of career possibilities and opportunities, even those that may seem unconventional or challenging.
    
5. **Pull vs. Push**: Shift the focus from "pushing" employees into predefined career paths to "pulling" them toward opportunities aligned with their interests and strengths. This approach empowers employees to take ownership of their career development journey.
    
6. **Presence**: Stress the importance of managers (and coaches) being present and actively engaged in employees' career development. This includes providing timely feedback, guidance, and support, as well as creating a culture that values continuous learning and growth.
    
7. **Patience**: Acknowledge that career development is a journey that unfolds over time. Managers (and coaches) should demonstrate patience and understanding as employees navigate their career paths, recognizing that progress may not always be linear or immediate.
