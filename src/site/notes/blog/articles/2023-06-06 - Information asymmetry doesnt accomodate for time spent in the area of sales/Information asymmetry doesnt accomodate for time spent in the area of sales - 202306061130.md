# Content

In [[reference/To Sell Is Human - Daniel H Pink\|To Sell Is Human]], they talk about the power being shifted to the buyer now that we live in an information age. I think it's possible we've actually swung the pendulum entirely the other direction such that there's so much information available now, including misinformation and disinformation, that a buyer could never spend enough time to properly identify all the ways a sales person could bend the sale to their advantage. Buyers now suffer from [[Information Overload\|Information Overload]] and sales people can leverage this for their [[Information Asymmetry\|Information Asymmetry]] and position themselves as an expert again.
