# Content

>[!NOTE]
>This is a facilitated group discussion I ran for a local Technical Architect meetup. It was meant to get a conversation going about what it means to be an architect and provide an opportunity for those not in the role yet to converse with those already in a architecture role about what it takes to succeed.

# So You Want to Be an Architect

Intention

- Find out what does 'architect' mean to us
- What does our current meetup group composition look like
- Share in our experience to help guide aspiring attendees or connect on problems we're trying to solve currently

- Raise your hand if:
	- Currently hold a title with the word 'architect' in it
	- You currently work as a person who is looked to for architectural guidance
	- You have taken on an architect role before (title not important)

We are going to do "Around the World"...

- You will be assigned into small groups
	- You will get markers and sticky notes
	- You will be stationed at a question that the group will discuss for 3 minutes (I will track time and let you know)
	- Place a sticky note or 2 on the question that best represents highlights in your discussion
	- Move to the next question, repeat
