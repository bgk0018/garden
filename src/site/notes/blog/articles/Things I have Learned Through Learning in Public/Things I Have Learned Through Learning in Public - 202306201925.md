# Content

- Focus on posting for yourself rather than others (Internal motivation)
	- Easier to write about the things you love rather than what you think others might love (reduce friction) which helps build habits[^1]
	- Avoids self censoring based on perceived expectation (Ideas usually just need to find the right audience)[^2]
	- Not sharing is self selecting out of discussion (if you put it in front of no one, you lose nothing, but you also gain nothing)
	- Even if you post for yourself, you'll still get an dopamine hit if someone likes or comments, this does motivate you to check more frequently and is potentially an entry to a bad habit
- Community brings perspective and opportunity
	- Those who are interested will be involved, those who do not will not engage (Network with those you align with)
	- This is a type of [[Sharing your what with your who\|Sharing your what with your who]] from [[reference/The Power of Who - Bob Beaudine\|The Power of Who]][^3]
	- If you are 'learning' in public, it's OK to be wrong, you're learning! Adopt a [[projects/Stagen Learning and Practice/Learner - 202208111646\|Learner Mindset]][^4] per [[reference/Fred Kofman\|Fred Kofman]]

>The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=670)) #✂️

# Learner Mindset

</div>



Those who approach the [[202208111642 - Learning Gap\|Learning Gap]] with a Learner mindset  are willing to admit they don't know. This awareness and admission of the learning gap allows them to approach situations with an open mind and a sense of ease as they learn new ways of understanding and doing things.

Learners tend to equate effort with improvement and assume that, in time, they will learn to succeed at the tasks with which they currently struggle. Therefor, they view 'doing badly' and the inevitable frustration that comes with it, as a normal part of the learning process.
