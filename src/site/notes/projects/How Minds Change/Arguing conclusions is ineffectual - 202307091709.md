# Content

Very rarely will an argument or fact [[projects/How Minds Change/Persuasion - 202307012230\|persuade]] someone is wrong. Facts are based on conclusions and arguing around conclusions is ineffectual.[^1][^2]

Justifications, explanations, and reasons are all endless for someone to rationalize their position. To make progress, you should not challenge someone's conclusions on a topic and rather [[projects/How Minds Change/Focus on the lived experience to change a mind - 202307091716\|Focus on the lived experience to change a mind]].[^3]

>“There is no superior argument, no piece of information that we can offer, that is going to change their mind,” he said, taking a long pause before continuing. “The only way they are going to change their mind is by changing their own mind—by talking themselves through their own thinking, by processing things they’ve never thought about before, things from their own life that are going to help them see things differently.” ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=628)) #✂️

>Steve explained that after thousands of recorded conversations they had found that battling over differing interpretations of the evidence kept the people they met from exploring why they felt so strongly one way or the other. People could remain in the logic space doing battle with the canvasser’s facts for hours and never leave, safe and unable to tap into why those facts evoked such powerful feelings. The LAB tried arguing the facts for years, and it had long proved a waste of time. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=659)) #✂️ #favorite

>[!QUOTE]  
>Steve would tell me later that they had learned over many conversations that reasons, justifications, and explanations for maintaining one’s existing opinion can be endless, spawning like heads of a hydra. If you cut away one, two more would appear to take its place. Deep canvassers want to avoid that unwinnable fight. To do that, they allow a person’s justifications to remain unchallenged. They nod and listen. The idea is to move forward, make the person feel heard and respected, avoid arguing over a person’s conclusions, and instead work to discover the motivations behind them. To that end, the next step is to evoke a person’s emotional response to the issue. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=709)) #✂️
