In [[Science Communication\|Science Communication]], this is a method of [[202307012230 - Persuasion\|Persuasion]] where if you lay out all the independent facts for a given conclusion, then everyone would come to agreement on what is true. This is an intuitive but unsuccessful approach to [[202307012230 - Persuasion\|Persuasion]].[^1]

>Each dreamed that one day we would all have access to all the same facts, and then, naturally, we would all agree on what those facts meant. In science communication, this used to be called the information deficit model, long debated among frustrated academics. When controversial research findings on everything from the theory of evolution to the dangers of leaded gasoline failed to convince the public, they’d contemplate how to best tweak the model so the facts could speak for themselves. But once independent websites, then social media, then podcasts, then YouTube began to speak for the facts and undermine the authority of fact-based professionals like journalists, doctors, and documentary filmmakers, the information deficit model was finally put to rest.
