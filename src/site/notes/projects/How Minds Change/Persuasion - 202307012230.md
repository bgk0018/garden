[[projects/How Minds Change/Persuasion - 202307012230\|Persuasion]] affects the feeling of [[projects/How Minds Change/Certainty - 202307012227\|Certainty]].[^1]

[[Daniel O'Keefe\|Daniel O'Keefe]] defines persuasion as "A successful intentional effort at influencing another's mental state through communication in a circumstance in which the persuadee has some measure of freedom."[^2]

All persuasion is self-persuasion because the only one that can convince someone of something is themselves. The internal dialog is the most important. External forces to persuade someone is most often just showing that change is possible.[^3]

>We will learn that, in many ways, persuasion is mostly encouraging people to realize change is possible. All persuasion is self-persuasion. People change or refuse based on their own desires, motivations, and internal counterarguing, and by focusing on these factors, an argument becomes more likely to change minds.
