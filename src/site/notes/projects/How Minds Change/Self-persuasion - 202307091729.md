The process someone goes through when faced with the process by which they arrived at their own conclusion. This begins with some form of unresolved introspection where people begin to find a more nuanced position if they produce their own counterarguments.[^1][^2]

Just the process of verbal [[Self-talk\|Self-talk]] can trigger this processing.

>In the training, they said it was here in the conversation that a deep canvasser must perform their most delicate work. Even if a person’s ratings don’t move, the canvasser knows people have begun to think about their emotions and wonder, “Why do I feel this way?” After a twinge of unresolved introspection, people become highly motivated to sort out their feelings. They will then produce a new set of justifications, weaker perhaps than before. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=721)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>As people explain themselves, they begin to produce fresh insights into why they feel one way or another. This indicates they’ve engaged in active processing. Instead of defending, they begin contemplating, and once a person is contemplating, they often produce their own counterarguments, and a newfound ambivalence washes over them. If enough counterarguments stack up, the balance may tip in favor of change. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=727)) #✂️ #favorite
