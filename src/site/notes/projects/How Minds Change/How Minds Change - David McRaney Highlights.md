### INTRODUCTION
>[!QUOTE]  
>I started to see the push and pull of our incessant arguing as a form of punctuated equilibrium. That’s what they call it in biology. When creatures have the capacity to change but there’s little encouragement to do so, they remain mostly the same from one generation to the next. But when the pressure to adapt increases, the pace of evolution increases in response. ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=159)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>We will see that the speed of change is inversely proportional to the strength of our certainty, and certainty is a feeling: somewhere between an emotion and a mood, more akin to hunger than to logic. Persuasion, no matter the source, is a force that affects that feeling. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=180)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>As Daniel O’Keefe, a professor of communication, defines it, persuasion is “a successful intentional effort at influencing another’s mental state through communication in a circumstance in which the persuadee has some measure of freedom.” ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=184)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>We will learn that, in many ways, persuasion is mostly encouraging people to realize change is possible. All persuasion is self-persuasion. People change or refuse based on their own desires, motivations, and internal counterarguing, and by focusing on these factors, an argument becomes more likely to change minds.

>[!QUOTE]  
>This is why it is so important to share your intentions up front. Not only does that keep you on solid ethical ground, but it also increases your chances of success. If you don’t, people will assume your intentions. Whatever they assume will become your “actual” position in their minds, and you run the risk of not having the conversation you intended.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The ability to change our minds, update our assumptions, and entertain other points of view is one of our greatest strengths, an evolved ability that comes free with every copy of the human brain. You soon will see why, to leverage that strength, we must avoid debate and start having conversations. Debates have winners and losers, and no one wants to be a loser. But if both sides feel safe to explore their reasoning, to think about their own thinking, to explore their motivations, we can each avoid the dead-end goal of winning an argument.

### POST-TRUTH
>[!QUOTE]  
>Each dreamed that one day we would all have access to all the same facts, and then, naturally, we would all agree on what those facts meant. In science communication, this used to be called the information deficit model, long debated among frustrated academics. When controversial research findings on everything from the theory of evolution to the dangers of leaded gasoline failed to convince the public, they’d contemplate how to best tweak the model so the facts could speak for themselves. But once independent websites, then social media, then podcasts, then YouTube began to speak for the facts and undermine the authority of fact-based professionals like journalists, doctors, and documentary filmmakers, the information deficit model was finally put to rest.

I sent an email, talked on the phone, explained my interest, and within a week was in California training with Steve’s organization, the Leadership LAB.

>After dozens of these training sessions the team had learned it was important to spend a lot of time stoking enthusiasm and dampening anxieties before getting into the particulars of how to talk to strangers about sensitive topics. To that end, they emphasized something they called “radical hospitality,” a form of selfless concern and energetic friendliness akin to what you might experience at a family reunion.

>“There is no superior argument, no piece of information that we can offer, that is going to change their mind,” he said, taking a long pause before continuing. “The only way they are going to change their mind is by changing their own mind—by talking themselves through their own thinking, by processing things they’ve never thought about before, things from their own life that are going to help them see things differently.” ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=628)) #✂️

It was there, and only there, he said, that a single conversation could change someone’s mind. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=640)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>Steve explained that after thousands of recorded conversations they had found that battling over differing interpretations of the evidence kept the people they met from exploring why they felt so strongly one way or the other. People could remain in the logic space doing battle with the canvasser’s facts for hours and never leave, safe and unable to tap into why those facts evoked such powerful feelings. The LAB tried arguing the facts for years, and it had long proved a waste of time. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=659)) #✂️ #favorite

>Once people see where their ideas come from, they become aware that they come from somewhere. They can then ask themselves if they’ve learned anything new in the time since they last considered them. Maybe those ideas need updating in some way. Deep canvassing is about gaining access to that emotional space, Steve explained, to “help them unload some baggage,” because that’s where mind change happens.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Steve would tell me later that they had learned over many conversations that reasons, justifications, and explanations for maintaining one’s existing opinion can be endless, spawning like heads of a hydra. If you cut away one, two more would appear to take its place. Deep canvassers want to avoid that unwinnable fight. To do that, they allow a person’s justifications to remain unchallenged. They nod and listen. The idea is to move forward, make the person feel heard and respected, avoid arguing over a person’s conclusions, and instead work to discover the motivations behind them. To that end, the next step is to evoke a person’s emotional response to the issue. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=709)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>In the training, they said it was here in the conversation that a deep canvasser must perform their most delicate work. Even if a person’s ratings don’t move, the canvasser knows people have begun to think about their emotions and wonder, “Why do I feel this way?” After a twinge of unresolved introspection, people become highly motivated to sort out their feelings. They will then produce a new set of justifications, weaker perhaps than before. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=721)) #✂️

>[!QUOTE]  
>As people explain themselves, they begin to produce fresh insights into why they feel one way or another. This indicates they’ve engaged in active processing. Instead of defending, they begin contemplating, and once a person is contemplating, they often produce their own counterarguments, and a newfound ambivalence washes over them. If enough counterarguments stack up, the balance may tip in favor of change. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=727)) #✂️ #favorite

It would remain private, and she wouldn’t feel like Steve was challenging her. She’d be challenging herself. And if he threw his support behind the conflicting thoughts that favored the opinion he was there to champion, she might shift in the direction he wanted.

In the training they called this “modeling vulnerability,” and the idea was that if you open up, so will they. He told her as a young gay man, he didn’t take proper precautions his first time, even though he was well aware of the dangers. He asked if Martha had ever been less than careful because of something like that. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=748)) #✂️

They call it “connecting on values.” Before you wrap up, you must make it clear where you stand, but in a way that shows you and the other person may agree on what is important at the core of the discussion. If you’ve done your job, the other side will know you aren’t aiming for a fight. Your position can be seen as just your perspective, perhaps one worth considering.

They asked college students whether spanking, a relatively neutral topic for that age group, was effective as a disciplinary tool. Some said yes, some no, but whatever subjects said they believed, the scientists then presented them with an essay that outlined strong arguments to the contrary. When they brought the subjects back into the lab after some time had passed, they asked about their spanking beliefs a second time. A portion of the group returned to Wolfe and Williams with changed opinions. Considering the persuasive essays, if they were pro-spanking before, they had become anti-spanking in the time since, and vice versa. But when Wolfe and Williams pulled those subjects aside and asked them to recall how they had originally answered at the beginning of the research, most reported that their answers hadn’t changed. Though the researchers had proof of it, the subjects themselves had no awareness of their own flips.

>[!QUOTE]  
>When I asked Broockman and Kalla for a lead or two, they said to look deeper into something psychologists call elaboration, a state of active learning in which a person unpacks a new idea by relating to something they already understand. For example, on first viewing, you might describe Alien as “Jaws in space,” but, if you saw Alien first, you might describe Jaws as “Alien in the ocean.” Most of the time, when on autopilot or performing routine tasks, we see the world as we expect to see it, and most of the time that’s fine; but the brain often gets things wrong because it prefers to sacrifice accuracy for speed. When we stop ourselves from going with our first instincts, or our “guts,” when we are thinking about our own thinking, we become more open to elaborating, to adding something new to ourselves by reaching a deeper understanding of something we thought we already understood quite well. In short, deep canvassing likely encourages elaboration by offering people an opportunity to stop and think.

Then the experimenter presented a randomized sheet of paper revealing the imaginary outcome. If it came up in their favor, the subjects were to imagine they had won $200. If it didn’t come up in their favor, the subjects imagined they lost $100. No matter the outcome, win or lose, the experimenter then asked, “You are now offered a second identical gamble. Do you take it?” In the first run of the experiment, when people won, they tended to say, “Yeah, I’d like to play again.” (I’m ahead, so I can risk it.) If they didn’t win, they tended to say, “Yeah, I would like to play again.” (I need to win back what I just lost.) Win or lose, they found a reason to take the second gamble. But here is the crazy part of this study: in a second run of this experiment, they didn’t tell people the outcome of their coin toss. And even though most would take the bet after either outcome, if they did not tell people the outcome, most people did not flip again. Why?

So when they heard more arguments, of any kind, even bad ones, they were more likely to support the policy than if presented with fewer.

>When your opponent seems emotional, we want to seem rational, so there’s a sense that emotions should never enter a debate, especially over the facts. But experts on reasoning like Schmid told me this was impossible, because certainty itself is an emotion.

>As Burton explained, beliefs and doubts are better thought of as processes, not possessions. They aren’t like marbles in a jar, books on a shelf, or files in a computer. Belief and doubt are the result of neurons in associative networks delivering an emergent sensation of confidence or the lack thereof. When those networks weight that feeling in one direction or another, we sense a proposition is either true or false.

### SOCIAL CHANGE
>[!QUOTE]  
>Our ancestors couldn’t build new bodies in the time it would take to match them to the new conditions, nor could they quickly evolve new brain structures with new built-in behavioral solutions to fit the novel environments. But their existing brains had developed a suite of tools for creating new behaviors on the fly and copying them from brain to brain—plasticity, abstraction, metacognition, language, social learning, perfect imitation, theory of mind, argumentation, and reasoning.

Fourth, they must engage in informal interactions, meeting one another outside of mandated or official contexts, like at one another’s homes or at public events. And finally, for prejudice to truly die out, the concerns of the oppressed must be recognized and addressed by an authority, ideally the one that writes laws.

>[!QUOTE]  
>The creation of new conceptual categories is the greatest sign that accommodation is occurring on a large scale, and thus social change is imminent. For instance, the term designated driver was invented by the Harvard Alcohol Project as a public health initiative and then seeded into popular television shows like Cheers and L.A. Law. Seeing characters put a name to a particular behavior created a new conceptual category in the viewer. If you accepted the term and used it, then it created dissonance with the urge to drink and drive. Why would there be a word for a person who drives his friends around while they drink if it’s perfectly okay to drink and drive? To resolve the dissonance, the existing model had to be updated—people who drink do not drive. ([Location 3962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B093R2CP2V&location=3962)) #✂️
