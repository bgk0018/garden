# Content

A way to close the conversation in [[projects/How Minds Change/Deep Canvassing - 202307091701\|Deep Canvassing]] by attempting to provide your position on the issue in the discussion, but in a way that shows it as an alternative to theirs and not condemnation of their position. This should be focused on a shared value or what is important.[^1]

>Steve said before he left that he believed all women should be able to choose for themselves without judgment. This moment is heavily emphasized in the training. They call it “connecting on values.” Before you wrap up, you must make it clear where you stand, but in a way that shows you and the other person may agree on what is important at the core of the discussion. If you’ve done your job, the other side will know you aren’t aiming for a fight. Your position can be seen as just your perspective, perhaps one worth considering.
