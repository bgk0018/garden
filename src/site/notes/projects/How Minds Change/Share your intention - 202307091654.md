If you don't share your intention up front, then the other person will assume it for you. Their perception of your intentions will ultimately be how they see.[^1]

>This is why it is so important to share your intentions up front. Not only does that keep you on solid ethical ground, but it also increases your chances of success. If you don’t, people will assume your intentions. Whatever they assume will become your “actual” position in their minds, and you run the risk of not having the conversation you intended.
