# Why Industrial Policy Is (Almost) Always a Bad Idea - Lukes Notes

Global Trade

- USA uses tariffs to affect global prices
- Trade deficits are paid by selling technology and real estate to foreign countries
- Trade Deficits are bad
- Tariffs can be used to raise money - decreasing US deficit spending - helps fix trade imbalances
- Moving jobs between states is not the same as shipping them abroad
- He talks a lot about xenophobia?

Yes, I value american workers more than foreign labor, this is a value judgement and kind of irrelevant to the podcasters argument, calling me xenophobic is a way of silencing disagreement

- GDP is not the be all end all of economic well being - the US has extremely high rates of suicide, fentanyl overdoses, alcoholism
- some of this stems from economic woes, some from existential dread, I think
- The podcasters don't give good solutions for people who lost their jobs to China - other than "just learn to code, bro"
	- People moving from manufacturing to tech at 55 is largely unrealisitic
- "Trade and innovation are the same" ...no?
- Trade deficits are paid by selling american tech and real estate to foreign adversaries
	- Also, this doesn't solve the issue of
		- "What dfo we do with people put out of work by innovation and trade"
		- Also international trade happens between countries, innovation happens within - foreign vs american

Conclusion:

- IMO, there are practical purposes to having an industrial base
- Trade deficits cause the sale of american assets, real estate, tech to service debt
- Supply chains are fragile
- Covid proved this having a manufacturing base could've helped mitigate disruption
	- Ability to manufacture guns and weaponry is key
	- We shipped so many missles to Ukraine we had to pull boomers from retirement to manufacture more, loss of human capital
	- Also ramping up manufacturing on short notice is harder than the podcasters let on - especially if we have poor human capital - lose human capital
	- Helps employ lesser human capital - some people will never learn to code - they simply don't have the intelligence or capability in many cases - these people still need jobs, the Neolibs have no solution to this problem - except maybe UBI
- A side note tariffs can also be used for negotiating trump threatened tariffs which Mexico to negotiate the "Remain in Mexico" policy
