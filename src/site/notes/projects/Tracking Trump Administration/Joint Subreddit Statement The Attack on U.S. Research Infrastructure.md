Many of you are likely familiar with the news of the Trump Administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminating grants and budgets at the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-under-orders-cancel-2-6-billion-contracts) (NIH), the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/science/trump-national-science-foundation-grants.html) (NSF), the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.wired.com/story/institute-museum-library-services-layoffs/) (IMLS), and the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/03/nx-s1-5350994/neh-grants-cut-humanities-doge-trump) (NEH), as well as posturing around the [Smithsonian Institution](https://fortune.com/2025/03/28/trump-smithsonian-museum-vance-doge-budget-cuts-science-arts-culture-diversity-dei/) and the [National Gallery of Art](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/washington-dc-national-gallery-of-art-gets-a-visit-from-doge).  There is no way to sugarcoat it. These actions endanger the intellectual freedom of every individual in the United States, and even impact the health and safety of people across the world by willfully tearing down the nation’s research infrastructure.  As moderators of academic subreddits, we engage with public audiences, every one of you, on a daily basis, and while you may not see the direct benefits of these institutions, you all experience the benefits of a federally supported research environment.  We feel it is our responsibility to share with you our thoughts and seek your help before the catastrophic consequences of these reckless actions.

Granting of research awards is  a dull bureaucracy behind exciting projects.  Each agency functions differently, but across agencies, research grants are a highly competitive process.  Teams of researchers led by a Primary Investigator (or PI) write an application to a specific grant program for funding to support a relevant project.  Most granting agencies,  require a narrative about the project’s purpose, rationale, and impacts, descriptions of anticipated outputs (like a website, a public dataset, software, conference presentations, etc), detailed budgets on how funding would be spent, work plans, and, if accepted, regular updates until project completion.   Funding pays for things like staff, equipment, travel,  promotional materials, and most importantly, the next generation of scholars through research assistantships.  PIs rarely see the total sum themselves, rather universities receive the grant on behalf of a project team and distribute the funds. Grants include “overhead” meaning a university receives a sizable portion of the funds to pay for building space, facilities, janitorial staff, electricity, air conditioning, etc. Overhead helps support the broader community by providing funds for non-academic employees and contracts with local businesses.

Grants from NIH, NSF, IMLS, and NEH make up a very small portion of the federal budget.  In 2024, the NIH received [$48.811 billion](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R43341#:%7E:text=In%20FY2024%2C%20NIH%20received%20a,increase%20\(less%20than%201%25).), the NSF [$9.06 billion](https://www.nsf.gov/about/budget/fy2024/appropriations), IMLS received [$294.8 million](https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/what-happens-to-libraries-if-imls-goes-away) and the NEH was given [$207 million](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48255#:%7E:text=National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Humanities,-NEH%20supports%20grants&text=The%20Federal/State%20Partnership%20program,in%20the%20FY2023%20appropriations%20act.&text=individuals%20with%20the%20exception%20of,or%20American%20Jazz%20Masters%20Fellowships.&text=Statement%20Regarding%20Consolidated-,Appropriations%20Act%2C%202024%2C%20Congressional%20Record%2C%20vol.,S1175%2C%20S1858.&text=Statement%20Regarding%20Consolidated-,Appropriations%20Act%2C%202024%2C%20Congressional%20Record%2C%20vol.,S1175%2C%20S1858.).  These numbers sound gigantic, and this $58.37 billion total sounds even more massive, but it’s less than 1% of the [$6.8 trillion](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61181) federal budget.  These are literal pennies for the sake of supposed efficiency. 

For Redditors, one immediate impact is [NSF defunding of research grants related to misinformation and disinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/science/trump-national-science-foundation-grants.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CE8.j1wq.BnsNtONSjcFk&smid=url-share).  As moderators of academic communities, fighting mis/disinformation is a crucial part of our work; from vaccine conspiracies to Holocaust denial, the internet is rife with dangerous content.  We moderate harmful content to allow our subscribers to read informed dialogue on topics, but research on how to combat misinformation is “[not in alignment with current NSF priorities](https://www.nsf.gov/updates-on-priorities)” under this administration. Research on content moderation has helped Reddit mods [reduce harassment](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1813486116) and [toxicity](http://eegilbert.org/papers/cscw18-chand-hate.pdf), [understand our communities’ needs better](https://shagunjhaver.com/research/articles/jhaver-2019-survey/jhaver-2019-survey.pdf), and [communicate what we do beyond the ban hammer](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/courses/graduate/691/spring23/pdf/3392822.pdf).  

For the humanities, the NEH terminated grants to reallocate funds [“in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”](https://newrepublic.com/article/193628/trump-grantee-termination-letters-education)  Every presidential administration will shift research interests, but these new guidelines are not in the interest of academic research, rather they seek to curate a specific vision and chill research ideas that disagree with a political agenda.  Under the executive order to restore [“Truth and Sanity to American History,”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/restoring-truth-and-sanity-to-american-history/) honest inquiry is subservient to nationalistic ideology, a move that [r/AskHistorians strongly opposes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jmmj3w/megathread_truth_sanity_and_history/).

Other agencies that provide key sources of information to academics and the public alike face layoffs including the [National Archives](https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-archives-firings-layoffs-historical-recordkeeping-559027fdd2f634263bea7774a78d66fe) and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://apnews.com/article/noaa-job-cuts-weather-forecasts-trump-doge-musk-7e35e9d5d757d8fc3f0f50b2bd71c87d). [Cuts to the Department of Education](https://www.chalkbeat.org/2025/02/11/elon-musk-and-doge-cancel-education-department-research-contracts/) are terminating studies, data collection, teacher access to research, and even [funds that help train teachers to support students](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/articles/2025/april/funding-cuts-to-deaf-education-impact-disabled-students--families/).  Meanwhile [cutting NASA’s funding jeopardizes the recently built Nancy Grace Roman Telescope](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-trying-cancel-nasas-successor-181957513.html) and [the National Park Service is removing terminology](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/14/g-s1-48923/stonewall-monument-transgender-park-service) to erase the historical contributions of transpeople.

[The NIH is seeking to pull funding from universities based on politics](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/21/us/nih-bans-grants-universities-dei-programs/index.html), not scientific rigor.  Many of these cuts come from the administration’s opposition to DEI or diversity, equity, and inclusion, and [it will kill people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/hiv-research-funding-cut/index.html).  Decisions to terminate research funding for HIV or studies focused on minority populations will harm other scientific breakthroughs, and research may answer questions unbeknownst to scientists.  Research opens doors to intellectual progress, often by sparking questions not yet asked.  [To ban research on a bad faith framing of DEI](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5289912/unprecedented-white-house-moves-to-control-science-funding-worry-researchers) is to assert one’s politics above academic freedom and tarnish the prospects of discovery.  Even where funding is not cut, [the sloppy review of research funding](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/31/nx-s1-5282162/scientists-grants-frozen-trump-executive-actions-dei-deia) halts progress and interrupts projects in damaging ways.

Beyond cuts to funding, the Trump administration is attacking the scholars and scientists who do the work.  At Harvard Medical School, [Kseniia Petrova’s work may aid cancer diagnostics but she has been held in an immigration detention center for two months](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-detain-kseniia-petrova-protest-harvard-cancer-research-rcna202180).  [The American Historical Association just released a statement condemning the targeting of foreign scholars](https://www.historians.org/news/american-historical-association-condemns-targeting-of-foreign-scholars/).  This is not solely an issue of federal funding, but an issue of inhumanity by the Trump Administration’s Department of Homeland Security.

The unfortunate political reality is that there is little we can do to stop the train now that it’s left the station.  [You can, and should, call your member of Congress](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member), but this is not enough.  **We need you to help us change minds.**  There are likely family members and loved ones in your life who support this effort.  Talk to them.  Explain how federal funds result in [medical breakthroughs](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/malaria-vaccines-provide-strong-lasting-immunity), how [library and museum grants](https://www.ala.org/news/2025/04/imls-cuts-put-americas-public-libraries-risk) support your community, and how [humanities research](https://nhalliance.org/nha-statement-neh-doge-threats/) connects us to our shared cultural heritage.  Is there an elder in your life who cares about [testing for Alzheimer’s disease?](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/accurate-blood-test-alzheimer-s-disease) A mother, sister, or daughter who cares about [the Women’s Health Initiative](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/womens-health-initiative-whi)?  A parent who wants their child to [read at grade level](https://www.imls.gov/our-work/partnerships/campaign-grade-level-reading)? A Civil War buff who’d love to see [soldier’s graffiti in historic homes preserved](https://rrchnm.org/news/carrying-on-when-the-grants-go-away/)?  Tell them that these agencies matter. Speak to your friends and neighbors about how [NIH support for research](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/mrna-vaccine-treat-pancreatic-cancer) offers compassion to a cancer patient by finding them a successful treatment, how [NEH funding of National History Day](https://www.socialstudies.org/current-events-response/statement-national-history-day-program-funding) gives students a passion for learning, and how [NSF dollars spent looking out into space](https://www.nsf.gov/news/astronomers-capture-first-image-black-hole) allow us to marvel at our universe.

We will not escape this moment ourselves.  As academics and moderators, we are not enough to protect our disciplines from these attacks.  We need you too.  [Write letters, sign petitions, and make phone calls](https://www.aclu.org/writing-your-elected-representatives), but more importantly talk with others.  Engage with us here on Reddit, share with your friends offline, and help us get the word out that our research infrastructure matters.  So many of us are privileged to work in academic research and adjacent areas because of public support, and we are so grateful to live out our enthusiasms, our zeal, our obsessions, and our love for the arts, humanities, and sciences, and in doing so, contributing to the public good.  Thank you for all the support you’ve given us over the years- to see millions of you appreciate the subjects that we’ve dedicated our lives to brings us so much joy that it feels wrong to ask for more, but the time has never been more consequential- please help us.  Go change one mind, gain us one more advocate and together we can protect the U.S. research infrastructure from further damage. We ask that experts in our respective communities also share examples in the comments of the dangers and effects of these political actions.  Lists of terminated grants are available here: [NIH](https://fedinvent.substack.com/p/hhs-published-a-list-of-canceled), [NSF](https://airtable.com/appGKlSVeXniQZkFC/shrFxbl1YTqb3AyOO?jntvk%3Aview=plaeS6fTnZvbmtQRS&jntvk%3Asort=eyJwZWw4ZlRSME8ycmFObWNUYyI6eyJjb2x1bW5JZCI6ImZsZDM1bDhTVUJTeUhtbktNIiwiYXNjZW5kaW5nIjp0cnVlfX0), [IMLS](https://www.cosla.org/imls-grant-cancellations), and [NEH](https://impact.ach.org/). Additional harm will be done by the lack of many future funding opportunities.
