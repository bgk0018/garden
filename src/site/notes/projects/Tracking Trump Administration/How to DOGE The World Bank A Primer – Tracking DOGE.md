Of all DOGE targets, none should be easier than the massive wealth transfer institutions of The World Bank Group and its sister multilateral development banks (MDBs).<sup data-fn="2da6cafc-2f22-4867-9aa2-39f682805ca3" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#2da6cafc-2f22-4867-9aa2-39f682805ca3" id="2da6cafc-2f22-4867-9aa2-39f682805ca3-link">1</a></sup>

Let’s get the important issue up front.  The articles of organization of each of these organizations provide for members leaving.  In the case of a member leaving, they get their money back.  The U.S. has more than $70 billion in appropriated and expended donations to these institutions.  Withdrawing from all of them would return to the U.S. Treasury vast sums to make room for President Trump’s tax cuts.<sup data-fn="37b2d837-6f55-44a0-ab5e-cf2b2974d9e8" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#37b2d837-6f55-44a0-ab5e-cf2b2974d9e8" id="37b2d837-6f55-44a0-ab5e-cf2b2974d9e8-link">2</a></sup>

A second important issue to clarify is the fact that the MDBs have failed at all aspects of their ever evolving missions.  The World Bank has existed for over 80 years.  World Bank President Ajay Banga – a Biden appointee – stated it clearly in the World Bank Annual Report in 2024: 

Rarely in our 80-year history has our work been more urgent: We face declining progress in our fight against poverty, an existential climate crisis, mounting public debt, food insecurity, an unequal pandemic recovery, and the effects of geopolitical conflict.

After 80 years, they have “declining progress”.  They just need more of, as Margaret Thatcher termed it, “other people’s money”.  Is this not a definition of failure?

Multilateral development banks have grown rapidly while failing at their ever evolving missions, leaving nothing but sprawling, tax-free bureaucracies to nibble at the edges of international trade and development with little oversight and decidedly destructive policy prescriptions.  Luckily for the world economy, their policy prescriptions are secondary issues to their leadership and staff.  Their interests are simple job security and expansion.

Withdrawal from the World Bank Group and the other multilateral development banks should be a priority for reconciliation and the “one big beautiful bill”. 

The staying power of these organizations show that they will be a challenge for DOGE.  However, they have vulnerabilities which should intrigue Mssrs. Musk and Ramaswamy who seem to enjoy a challenge. 

This document offers a roadmap of these vulnerabilities and how to attack them.  It focuses on the World Bank Group’s main lending arm, the International Bank for Reconstructions and Development, but the principles apply to the entire complex of such institutions.

**A Bit of History**

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bank began as part of the Bretton Woods Agreements in 1944.<sup data-fn="c37ac4e0-b42e-4cef-bbb3-e564204d8fe3" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#c37ac4e0-b42e-4cef-bbb3-e564204d8fe3" id="c37ac4e0-b42e-4cef-bbb3-e564204d8fe3-link">3</a></sup>  As its name implies, its purpose was to provide capital to rebuild the ravaged world, particularly Europe, following WWII while institutions were rebuilt and commercial capital flows resumed.  That mission, as is rather obvious, has long been rendered unnecessary.

Like any self-respecting bureaucratic entity, IBRD has engaged in mission creep but on a scale unimagined by others.  From refinancing Europe, its “mission” has grown to be global even as the failure of its policy advice and projects verges on the comical. 

To add insult to injury, it is now fully focused on global Green New Deal projects and embedding DEI in all of its projects – with ever increasing financial risk to American taxpayers.

Successive U.S. administrations and Congresses have been complicit in allowing, even encouraging, the continued existence and expansion of the IBRD despite all evidence of its failures and anti-American positions.  Notably, the Reagan and first Trump administrations not only failed to achieve substantive reforms of the IBRD but actually were advocates for its expansion. 

The Reagan Treasury early produced a “white paper” showing that the IBRD promoted American interests.  Of course, this was prepared by the very staff whose jobs depended on the existence of the IBRD and many of whom went on to receive lucrative appointments within the IBRD and its sister organizations including the International Monetary Fund.  IBRD advocates used the Reagan “white paper” to successfully attack Congressional opposition to IBRD funding and policies.  More funding followed.

In the first Trump administration, with the full support of the Trump Department of Treasury, the IBRD received a more than $60 billion funding increase plus a doubling of funds for its sister institution, the International Finance Corporation.  

The IBRD promptly used these funds to double its Green New Deal agenda and promote DEI as part of its lending programs. What were the Trump appointees thinking?

The Trump nominee for president of the World Bank – who had overseen the funding increase while at Treasury – was allowed to take office.  After the ink was dry on the funding, he was hounded out of office for being insufficiently woke on climate issues. These bureaucrats play tough.

President Trump should require a written statement from every appointee to the Departments of Treasury and State (including the nominees for Secretary) with influence over international financial issues that they will steadfastly oppose any additional funding for multilateral development banks and wholeheartedly support his goal of withdrawing from each and every one.  Senators interviewing these candidates should demand public reiteration of these pledges.

The Biden administration, under the guidance of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, has been leading the charge for enlarging the bank to the detriment of U.S. taxpayers.  On her way out the door, she committed taxpayers to an additional $4 billion in contributions to the concessional grant facility known as the International Development Association.  In 2021, she oversaw a $3.5 billion contribution.  Not coincidentally, the very lucrative presidency of the World Bank is open in 2028.  It pays – tax free – double what the Secretary of the Treasury is paid with a retirement plan an American worker could only dream of.

The beat goes on.

**Reconciliation: One Big Beautiful Bill**

The most direct and beneficial way to withdraw from the IBRD is to include language in the upcoming reconciliation bill amending Sec. 2 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to remove the authorization for the U.S. to accept membership in the bank.  This would trigger presidential action to withdraw the U.S. from membership.

Termination of membership, under the Bretton Woods agreements, results in a return of all monies contributed to the IBRD and removes the former member from any liabilities for future IBRD borrowing.  For the IBRD, this would be around $3.7 billion.  Withdrawal from all of the MDB’s would return in excess of $70 billion to U.S. taxpayers.<sup data-fn="11725c4b-14f3-41e2-9060-5217d440f55b" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#11725c4b-14f3-41e2-9060-5217d440f55b" id="11725c4b-14f3-41e2-9060-5217d440f55b-link">4</a></sup>

The good news is that legislative language withdrawing the U.S. from the IBRD – indeed any of the multilateral development banks – can be included in the “one big beautiful” reconciliation bill.  Normally, the Byrd Rule in the Senate would preclude such language.  However, since withdrawing from these foreign aid banks results in the return of U.S. contributions, it is not “extraneous” to the instructions to the committee of jurisdiction.  It has a direct impact on the budget under consideration.  

Undoubtedly, supporters will call a point of order.  Fine.  Foreign aid versus taxpayers is a good argument to have.

**Other Lines of Attack**

There will be severe opposition to withdrawing from the IBRD.  While virtually no one in America has heard of it, it has many supporters in Washington and amongst those who profit from its largesse.  Not least of these will be the money center banks who profit from IBRD bond financing.  Vociferous opposition can also be expected from Departments of Treasury and State where the bureaucracies dependent on the IBRD for their jobs reside.  Political appointees who have not been properly vetted can be expected to lead the opposition.   

There are a number of additional actions which can be taken by the President and Congress to effectively end additional funding and reduce exposure to unfunded liabilities while the process of withdrawal unfolds.  These actions include:

- An Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Treasury, as Chairman of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies and U.S. Governor of the IBRD, to transmit to the IBRD notice of U.S withdrawal of its membership.

The Bretton Woods Agreements Act authorized the President to “accept membership” in the IBRD.  It stands to reason that if a President can “accept” then a President may “withdraw”.  The President should do just that. 

There will be claims that the President needs Congressional authorization to withdraw membership.  He should simply withdraw and let them yell, sue if they like.  It would make a very interesting court case for a plaintiff to defend foreign aid, especially that flowing through an exorbitantly paid international bureaucracy, while the Solicitor General defends American taxpayers.
- There should be no funding requests for the IBRD in the President’s budget.

Keeping funding out of the President’s budget is paramount.  The President needs to lay down a marker that the IBRD and sister institutions are being eliminated from U.S. taxpayer funding.  He must force advocates of this foreign aid to publicly propose adding funding and explain what they would eliminate from the budget to prevent an increase in the deficit.

The budget should include a request that all appropriation language regarding subscriptions to callable capital include a provision clearly stating that such subscriptions do not constitute a “full faith and credit” commitment and are subject to future appropriations.  (more on this below)
- Inclusion in the President’s budget of a rescission of all unspent appropriations for the IBRD including appropriations and authorizations of “callable capital” subscriptions.

The IBRD is financed in two ways.<sup data-fn="39ff0836-65c7-414d-9873-65413ebbbc7b" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#39ff0836-65c7-414d-9873-65413ebbbc7b" id="39ff0836-65c7-414d-9873-65413ebbbc7b-link">5</a></sup>  The first is by “paid-in capital” which is a direct appropriation.  The authorizing language for these appropriations reads that they are made “without fiscal year limitation”.  The appropriation language includes the phrase: “to remain available until expended”.  Rescinding all prior appropriations will assure that any monies which have not been “expended” stay that way.

The second financing mechanism is by “callable capital”.  Callable capital is not paid directly to the IBRD but is a commitment of donors against which the IBRD sells bonds on the public market.  Over the years, this has created a $53 billion contingent liability for U.S. taxpayers.<sup data-fn="d0a5464f-c9a9-4b22-b7d9-c238df905ea2" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#d0a5464f-c9a9-4b22-b7d9-c238df905ea2" id="d0a5464f-c9a9-4b22-b7d9-c238df905ea2-link">6</a></sup>  Prior to the late 1970’s there were appropriations to cover these amounts, approximately $7.7 billion.  Since – and this is the vast majority of the commitment – there have been no actual appropriations.  Instead, language in the appropriations bills states that “The United States Governor…may subscribe without fiscal year limitation” to callable capital.  A rescission will make certain that none of the prior callable capital appropriations or subscriptions can result in spending absent a new appropriation. 

An explanation of the nature of the portions of callable capital which have not been appropriated is below.
- The President should instruct the Secretary of the Treasury, as U.S. Governor of the IBRD, to notify the IBRD that a call on any callable capital subscribed to by the United States but not appropriated by Congress would be subject to specific appropriation by Congress and is not, therefore, a full faith and credit guarantee of the United States.  
The IBRD is well aware that there is a problem with callable capital.  It launched a major effort in 2024 to try to establish that callable capital subscriptions not backed by actual appropriations from member countries “are legally binding and backed by the full faith of shareholder countries”.  Secretary Janet Yellen – a major proponent of expanding the IBRD – reiterated this position in her response to an IBRD request.<sup data-fn="e9d39b36-bf93-4c65-860a-257284ba810b" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#e9d39b36-bf93-4c65-860a-257284ba810b" id="e9d39b36-bf93-4c65-860a-257284ba810b-link">7</a></sup>

You don’t go to such lengths if you are not trying to cover up a problem. Fortunately for American taxpayers, Janet Yellen saying it doesn’t make it true.

Yellen added “To date, no authorizing statute has provided that such subscriptions are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.”

The President should specifically clarify the U.S. position on this issue and remove any doubt that any call on U.S. taxpayers is subject to the will of Congress and, unlike U.S. government securities, is not a full faith and credit obligation.  

Moreover, all future legislation – including reconciliation bills and continuing resolutions – should assert Congressional authority over spending and include language excluding callable capital as full faith and credit obligation.
- The President should request the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies, to terminate treatment of IBRD securities as exempt securities and subject them to the same treatment as any securities in U.S. markets.

Under the Sec. 15 (a) of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, IBRD securities are “exempt securities” with the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933.<sup data-fn="f132402e-0872-4a00-b4a6-a04addcc2324" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#f132402e-0872-4a00-b4a6-a04addcc2324" id="f132402e-0872-4a00-b4a6-a04addcc2324-link">8</a></sup>  This places IBRD securities on a par with U.S. government securities and removes important safeguards for American investors. 

Under the same statute, the SEC, in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, can suspend this provision at any time

Suspending the exempt status of IBRD bonds would place them on the same footing as commercial bonds and protect American investors.  In addition, it would further demonstrate that IBRD bonds are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. taxpayer.

These bonds are listed primarily on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.  The U.S. is the primary funder of the IBRD but they keep well away from U.S. regulation.
- In addition to removing IBRD financing as a potential burden on U.S. taxpayers, Congress should investigate the AAA ratings of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch given to IBRD bonds.  This could be done by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in House Financial Services or by the DOGE Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight.

If these bonds are not backed by U.S. taxpayers, why do they rate them higher than Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan?  Would you trust a bunch of bureaucrats with your money more than Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffet?  What is the risk to Americans who buy them?  Should they receive a 0% risk rating under Basel III?<sup data-fn="9db6d454-89d3-4068-849f-9347d692676e" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#9db6d454-89d3-4068-849f-9347d692676e" id="9db6d454-89d3-4068-849f-9347d692676e-link">9</a></sup>
- The President should instruct the Secretary of the Treasury, as Governor of the IBRD, and the U.S. Executive Director of the IBRD to take whatever actions necessary to eliminate the IBRD Tax Allowance System.

Non-U.S. employees of the IBRD are exempt from U.S. income and Social Security taxes (see below).  U.S. employees are subject to these taxes but, under the Tax Allowance System, they are reimbursed by the IBRD for these taxes.  Thus, American workers who are taxed and who, generally, earn far less than those working at IBRD, are subsidizing their countrymen at IBRD. 

The IBRD argument for this is that the U.S. employees are at a disadvantage to non-U.S. employees.  The DOGE question is, what about other Americans?
- An Executive Order removing the IBRD from designation as “a public international organization” for purposes of the International Organizations Immunities Act together with a Presidential request to the Congress that Sec. 11. of The Bretton Woods Agreements Act regarding Status, Immunities and Privileges be amended to remove any reference to “Article VII Section 9. Immunities from Taxation” of the IBRD Articles of Agreement.<sup data-fn="b2a3997e-2d1d-463d-a874-14f279e96352" class="fn"><a href="https://trackingdoge.com/how-to-doge-the-world-bank-a-primer/#b2a3997e-2d1d-463d-a874-14f279e96352" id="b2a3997e-2d1d-463d-a874-14f279e96352-link">10</a></sup> 

These actions will remove the tax-free status of the IBRD thus subjecting all employees of the IBRD to taxation of salaries and emoluments and IBRD property in the United States, particularly its real property in the District of Columbia an Maryland, to property tax. 

Why should IBRD employees and property be tax exempt?  IBRD employees are very highly paid with almost total job security.  Their privileged position allows them sufficient surplus income to belong to their own Bretton Woods Country Club in the Washington suburbs (technically owned by the International Monetary Fund) – which itself is tax exempt.  The country club is vallued at $51,741,600 by Montgomery County. The last property tax bill for this country club was $438.78!  It covers sewer service. 

The IBRD headquarters at 1818 H Street NW in Washington is assessed at $719 million.  Total property tax paid is $0.
- The President should instruct the Secretary of the Treasury, as Governor of the IBRD, and the U.S. Executive Director of the IBRD to take whatever actions necessary to prevent the IBRD and other agencies of the World Bank group from making loans or loan guarantees or providing any other financial assistance to Chinese local governments including “Local Government Financing Vehicles”.

The IBRD has been working diligently – with the assistance of Secretary Yellen – to expand lending capacity without asking for additional contributions.  They are doing this by reducing the amount of equity held for each dollar of borrowing and, bizarrely, beginning to count callable capital as real equity.

At the same time, IBRD is working to expand its lending to non-sovereign, sub-national entities.  This means cities and their financing vehicles.  It is not a leap of logic to connect these two and come up with a Chinese bailout.  Chinese cities are crumbling under debt particularly that of their Local Government Financing Vehicles.  The new IBRD efforts are tailor made for a bailout.

**Conclusion**

Hopefully, this Primer will stimulate DOGE to action on the MDBs, end the massive wealth transfer from American taxpayers to international financial organizations and bureaucrats and turn some $70 billion in support of continuation of the 2017 tax reductions.
