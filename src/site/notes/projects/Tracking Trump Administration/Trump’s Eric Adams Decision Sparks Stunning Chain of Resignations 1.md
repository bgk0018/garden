Three senior Justice Department officials [resigned](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/top-federal-prosecutor-ny-resigns-told-drop-adams-charges-rcna192030) Thursday rather than drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. 

On Monday, acting U.S. Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered federal prosecutors in New York to [drop the charges](https://newrepublic.com/article/191430/trump-bondi-justice-corruption-roberts) against Adams, claiming that they limited Adams’s ability to help President Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. Apparently, that did not sit well with the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Danielle Sassoon, who opted to [resign](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/top-federal-prosecutor-ny-resigns-told-drop-adams-charges-rcna192030) instead.   

After her office refused to drop the charges against Adams, the DOJ then sought to move the case over to the agency’s Public Integrity Section in Washington, D.C., which handles all federal public corruption cases. But then, the section’s acting head, John Keller, left his position rather than drop the charges. 

As a result, Adams’s case went to the DOJ’s criminal division, which oversees every federal criminal case in the country. Kevin Driscoll, the division’s acting head, didn’t want to drop the charges either, and he then resigned. 

Of all three, [Sassoon’s resignation](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/top-federal-prosecutor-ny-resigns-told-drop-adams-charges-rcna192030) is the most surprising, considering that she has a strong conservative resume. A member of the influential [Federalist Society](https://newrepublic.com/article/189076/judicial-extremists-run-federalist-society), she once clerked for Supreme Court Justice and conservative stalwart Antonin Scalia. More recently, she captured the national spotlight for prosecuting cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.

The stunning sequence of events evokes memories of the “[Saturday Night Massacre](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-was-the-saturday-night-massacre/)” of 1973, when President Nixon tried to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was tasked with investigating the infamous Watergate scandal, causing the top two officials in the DOJ to resign instead. It was only the third ranking DOJ official at the time, conservative Robert Bork, who finally agreed to carry out the firing. 

The Trump administration appears to be doing Adams a favor for [cozying up](https://newrepublic.com/post/190511/eric-adams-tucker-carlson-interview) to the president, ignoring the [multiple counts](https://newrepublic.com/post/186407/eric-adams-charges-turkey-damning) of fraud and bribery against Adams for actions going back to 2014, when he was Brooklyn borough president. It seems that some of the DOJ’s prosecutors can see the corruption coming from on high, even those with right-wing backgrounds.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum threatened Thursday to sue Google after it changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico in its maps, in compliance with Donald Trump’s superficial executive order.

Google [announced](https://blog.google/products/maps/united-states-geographic-name-change-feb-2025/) Tuesday that it had updated the name of the body of water on its maps system, keeping with the standards set by the federal Geographic Names Information System. In the U.S., the name would appear as the inane “Gulf of America”; in Mexico, the “Gulf of Mexico”; and everywhere else would see a monstrous “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).”

During a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that her government had exchanged letters with Google about the issue but that the company had not resolved the complaints.

“Who we have a dispute with is Google,” Sheinbaum said, [according](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-13/mexico-s-sheinbaum-threatens-to-sue-google-over-gulf-of-america-maps-change) to Bloomberg. “If they keep insisting, we’ll consider a lawsuit.”

Sheinbaum argued that Trump’s vanity project could remain but that it needed to be limited to a small section of the gulf, saying that “the only place it was effective was where \[the U.S.\] has sovereignty, or up to 22 nautical miles from the coast,” [according](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-could-file-suit-against-google-gulf-mexico-name-change-president-says-2025-02-13/) to Reuters.

It’s worth noting that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was among those [invited](https://newrepublic.com/post/190443/donald-trump-tech-ceos-priority-inauguration-fires) to flank Trump at the inauguration, cementing just how important the administration’s ties to Silicon Valley are and just how much these pitiable tech bros hope to stay in the pocket of the president.

Trump wants a former Amazon executive to lead the country’s workplace safety agency.

On Wednesday, the president [nominated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/nominations-sent-to-the-senate/) David Keeling to serve as head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is tasked with maintaining safe and humane working conditions for American workers. Keeling previously oversaw safety at Amazon and UPS.

Both of those companies have been cited for various workplace safety violations by the very agency Keeling is set to control, if confirmed by the Senate. In 2019, OSHA cited UPS for forcing its drivers to work in “excessive heat” with no air conditioning. That same year, UPS was also cited for fire hazards at packaging facilities. Amazon has been cited numerous times for the dangerous, high-pressure environments in its warehouses, as well as the long hours its employees are forced to spend in them. Just last year, Amazon paid a [$145,000](https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/osha-national-news-release/20241219) settlement over OSHA violations.

Keeling worked as director of safety compliance for UPS from 2011 to 2018 before serving as the vice president of global health and safety from 2018 to 2021, overlapping with OSHA’s 2019 safety citations. The [same](https://thesoc.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/342/PrimedForPain.pdf) can be said for Amazon, where he worked from 2021 to 2023—a time when Amazon had one of the [highest](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-worker-injuries-labor-union-analysis/#:~:text=The%20report%2C%20which%20was%20compiled,its%20trying%20to%20improve%20it.) warehouse injury rates in the country.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the United States, but before meeting with President Trump, he met with someone arguably more powerful: Elon Musk.

At Blair House in Washington, D.C., Thursday, Musk and Modi discussed “space, mobility, technology and innovation,” according to a [post](https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1890100201496748210) from Modi’s X account. Modi also met with three of [Musk’s children](https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1890099707311190205).

![X screenshot Narendra Modi @narendramodi: It was also a delight to meet Mr. @elonmusk ’s family and to talk about a wide range of subjects! (with 4 photos of Narenda Modi, Elon Musk, and Elon’s three young children)](https://images.newrepublic.com/6806a14b5b1f2c1b13bbaecf0f3cb76f2ee79d7e.png?w=1166)

Several parts of Musk’s businesses concern India. The tech mogul is trying to get access for his Starlink satellite internet service in the country, and is [fighting](https://www.reuters.com/world/indias-modi-holds-meeting-with-billionaire-tesla-ceo-musk-2025-02-13/) with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who has competing interests. Musk also is trying to sell low-cost Tesla vehicles in India and get past the country’s tariffs on [electric vehicles](https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/musk-modi-meeting-tesla-ev-tariff-starlink-isro-19558329.htm).

All of this has prompted critics to question what exactly Musk’s role is in the federal government—and why he’s meeting with foreign leaders. Senator Chris Murphy pointed out some of his conflicts of interests, and the self-serving nature of his meeting.

![X screenshot Chris Murphy 🟧 @ChrisMurphyCT: Musk is effectively operating as the Secretary of State, and he is meeting with a key foreign leader not to ask for concessions that would benefit Americans, but for concessions that would make him rich. It's shameless corruption at a scale never seen before in our history. (with screenshot of article that reads: Musk-Modi Meeting: Tesla CEO may seek EV tariff reduction, Starlink license, and ISRO collaboration)](https://images.newrepublic.com/cedf7c146b2ca971743c03f133c69dd53a237cb8.png?w=1090)

Musk’s [Department of Government Efficiency](https://newrepublic.com/article/191037/elon-musk-destroy-federal-government) is supposedly meant to reduce costs and streamline government for the benefit of the American people. If the tech mogul is meeting leaders like Modi in Washington, D.C., he is effectively acting like a diplomat, as Murphy noted, but in his own interests rather than those of the country. The fact that Modi is meeting with Musk before Trump suggests that the [fascist](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/09/30/arundhati-roy-in-india-the-political-thinkers-in-modi-s-party-openly-worshiped-hitler-and-mussolini_6142003_4.html) Indian leader sees the [fascist](https://newrepublic.com/post/190464/did-elon-musk-nazi-salute-trump-inauguration) tech CEO as more important than the president.

Donald Trump on Thursday announced his intention to impose “reciprocal tariffs” on America’s trading partners.

Trump instructed his trade advisers and federal agencies to examine “reciprocal tariffs” on a “country-by-country” basis. The tariffs would begin with nations with which the U.S. determines it has the highest trade deficit, according to a senior White House official who spoke with the [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/bcc61d3b-bdc6-4f19-be1b-944e0be213c1). Trump’s memo likened the U.S. trade deficit to an issue of national security.

“India traditionally is just about the highest country, tariffs,” Trump said in a taped playback that the White House did not allow to be broadcast live from the Oval Office. “They’re at the top of the pack.”

Trump also highlighted what he perceived to be poor trade dynamics with the European Union and Canada, suggesting once again that America’s northern neighbor could become the country’s “fifty-first state” while referring to its outgoing leader as “Governor Trudeau.”

“Whatever they’re charging us, we’ll charge them,” the president said, bringing up Harley Davidson’s manufacturing issues with the country. Trump also promised that “prices will stay the same, go down,” or “go up short-term” as a result of the tariffs, that the nation will see an influx of jobs, and that “farmers will be helped very much.”

“Nobody really knows what will happen,” Trump said.

Trump’s unconfirmed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted that if “they drop their tariffs, prices will go down,” suggesting that nations around the world would drop their tariffs in order to aid American consumers. “It’s a two-way street,” he said.

White House officials said the administration would use a multipronged legal approach to implement the tariffs, in part pointing to Section 301 of the Trade Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Trump initially announced the impending tariff proposal while aboard Air Force One on Sunday, promising that reciprocal tariffs would be coming for “every country” that imposes import duties on U.S. goods.

“Very simply it’s if they charge us, we charge them,” he said, according to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-reciprocal-rcna191401).

The tariffs, which Trump first proposed would go into effect “immediately,” will actually not go into effect for several months. Instead, they have a possible start date of April 1, according to White House officials that spoke with [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-news-conference.html).

The U.S. has a weighted average import tariff rate of 2 percent on industrial goods, an umbrella category that encompasses practically all consumer goods outside of food.

“Weighted average tariff rates give special consideration to the value of a country’s imports,” reported [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/economy/new-us-trump-tariffs/index.html). “That means that if one country’s exports are subject to tariffs in another country and they constitute a large portion of the country’s overall imports, their weighted average tariff rate will be higher compared to another country whose exports accounts for a small share.”

EU leaders have already vowed to fight back against Trump’s sweeping tariff plan. Although economic advisers have brushed off Trump’s [campaign promise](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/agenda47-cementing-fair-and-reciprocal-trade-with-the-trump-reciprocal-trade-act?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=230720-agenda47_rescuing_americas_auto_industry_from_joe_bidens_disastrous_job_killing_policies&amp;utm_content=ncl-jDawVRuXPR&amp;_nlid=jDawVRuXPR&amp;_nhids=3KnUjPE) as a blunt negotiating strategy, top U.S. allies in Europe have spent months composing a “Trump Task Force” to ready their respective countries for what they believe could boil into a painful trade war.

“I will never support the idea of fighting allies,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters in Brussels on Monday. “But of course, if the U.S. puts tough tariffs on Europe, we need a collective and robust response.”

Trump’s previous tariff proposals are predicted to affect just about [every product](https://newrepublic.com/post/191051/everything-donald-trump-tariffs-expensive) under the sun, from ground beef and bananas to liquor and gas. On Monday, Trump [reinstated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-section-232-tariffs/) his 2018 tariff on steel and aluminum, raising tariffs for both to 25 percent. The new regulation is slated to [take effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/business/economy/tariffs-steel-aluminum-manufacturing.html) March 12. Once it does, production costs for America’s automakers are likely to jump, as will costs for the country’s construction industry, which is already [struggling](https://hbr.org/2024/09/the-market-alone-cant-fix-the-u-s-housing-crisis) to meet the demands of a historic nationwide housing crisis.

Trump has leaned into tariffs as a [key component](https://newrepublic.com/post/190399/republicans-plan-cut-school-food-tax-cuts) of affording an extension to his 2017 tax plan, which overwhelmingly benefits corporations and is projected to add as much as $15 trillion to the national deficit. But experts believe that a trade war would be to the overwhelming detriment of American consumers and its allies abroad—and that the self-inflicted pain could only serve to benefit U.S. adversaries around the globe.

The EU’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas [warned](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/european-leaders-warn-pain-transatlantic-trade-war-2025-02-03/) Monday that if the U.S. and the European Union were to enter into a trade war, then “the one laughing on the side is China.”

Several U.S. attorneys in federal court districts were fired Wednesday night “at the direction of the President of the United States.”

At least two court-appointed U.S. attorneys were forced out. One of those included a career federal prosecutor who had worked on January 6 cases, reported [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/white-house-terminates-top-federal-prosecutors-doj-fbi-purge-rcna192008) Thursday.

The White House–instructed layoff came as a surprise to the Justice Department, which has historically been the entity to request resignations from politically appointed attorneys.

A Justice Department spokesman could not answer how many of the nation’s 93 U.S. attorneys were impacted, according to NBC.

U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California Tara McGrath was informed that she would no longer serve as the chief federal law enforcement official for San Diego in a “communication from the White House,” according to a [press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/us-attorney-tara-mcgrath-concludes-tenure-chief-law-enforcement-officer-southern) from McGrath’s office that noted First Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew R. Haden would take her place, effective immediately.

U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington Tessa Gorman was also “removed from her post,” a spokesperson for the office told NBC.

U.S. Attorney for Maryland Erek L. Barron and U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina Dena J. King [announced](https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/us-attorney-erek-l-barron-announces-resignation) their [departures](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdnc/pr/united-states-attorney-dena-j-king-announces-departure-after-serving-chief-law) Wednesday as well, though they did not specify if they had been similarly forced out by the Trump administration.

An unidentified source familiar with the matter told NBC that the notices had been issued by Trent Morse, the deputy director of the Office of Presidential Personnel. The letters read: “At the direction of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as U.S. Attorney is terminated, effective immediately.”

The unprecedented dismissals come at a time when Trump’s pick to run the FBI, Kash Patel, has been [accused](https://newrepublic.com/post/191418/donald-trump-kash-patel-fbi-purge) of lying to Congress about directing a “purge” of the bureau while still a private citizen.

Gutting America’s prosecutorial abilities is apparently a top priority for the convicted felon in chief’s second term. Last month, Trump’s team ransacked FBI leadership, firing the top five career positions at the bureau, according to [*The Hill*](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5138452-durbin-kash-patel-fbi/). The administration also conducted a mass firing of more than a dozen career prosecutors who had worked directly with former special counsel Jack Smith as he developed two cases against Trump: one into Trump’s alleged retention of classified documents after he left the White House in 2021, and another into Trump’s involvement in the January 6 riots.

The matter boiled down to “[trust](https://newrepublic.com/post/190766/donald-trump-punishing-lawsuits-justice-department)” for the incoming administration, which claimed that the prosecutors had weaponized the government against the MAGA leader and had no place in his administration.

Donald Trump [announced](https://x.com/jbendery/status/1890095991233315030) more than a dozen new additions to the John F. Kennedy Center’s Board of Trustees Thursday, shortly after making himself the president of the prestigious performing arts organization.

Trump [claimed](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113992617804848860) he had been “unanimously” picked to serve as chairman of the Kennedy Center in a Truth Social post Wednesday, but a source familiar with the vote [told](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/kennedy-center-chair-trump-elected-board/index.html) CNN that some abstained or voted against his ascension. He had already [declared](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113964959500715895) his intention to become the chair last week, as well as his plan to immediately terminate several members of the board.

In a [press release](https://x.com/jbendery/status/1890095991233315030) from the White House Thursday, Trump announced the list of new additions to the board of trustees, which included White House insiders such as second lady Usha Vance, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Wiles’s mother, Cheri Summerall, and deputy White House chief of staff Dan Scavino.

Allison Lutnick, the wife of Howard Lutnick, Trump’s soon-to-be confirmed secretary of commerce, and Trump’s presidential personnel office director, Sergio Gor, also earned a spot on the board, [according](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/kennedy-center-chair-trump-elected-board/index.html) to CNN. Gor had been the one who emailed the ousted Democratic appointees alerting them that their positions had been terminated, [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/trump-kennedy-center.html) reported.

Trump also named his ally and former acting director of national intelligence Ric Grenell to serve as the organization’s interim executive director, which is a position that did not exist prior to his appointment.

Trump appointed John Falconetti, Lynda Lomangino, former White House adviser to the first lady Pamela Gross, and megadonors Patricia Duggan and Emilia May Fanjul, as well. Also among the newcomers are Mindy Levine, the wife of New York Yankees president Randy Levine, and Dana Blumberg, the wife of Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

The incoming trustees will replace several Democratic members. The White House [announced](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/politics/trump-elected-kennedy-center-chairman-president-deborah-rutters-ousted/65-e26a36eb-efa0-492d-8bac-fbf9c3e9a6e6) those include Joe Biden’s former press secretary Karine Jean Pierre, the finance chair of the Democratic National Committee Chris Korge, musician Jonathan Batiste, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Democratic donor Cari Sacks.

There are now [31 members](https://www.kennedy-center.org/about-us/leadership/trustees/) on the board of trustees.

Trump’s takeover has also led to the [immediate departure](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/kennedy-center-chair-trump-elected-board/index.html) of several high-ranking Kennedy Center appointments. Shonda Rhimes, who served as the board’s treasurer, resigned Wednesday, and artistic advisers Renee Fleming and Ben Folds announced they’d be vacating their roles at the Kennedy Center and National Symphony Orchestra, respectively.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had no clear answer Thursday when asked outright what concessions Russia would be making in peace negotiations with Ukraine.

“You have focused on what Ukraine is giving up. What concessions will \[Vladimir\] Putin be asked to make?” a reporter asked Hegseth at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

“Um, well that’s—I would start by saying the arguments that have been made that somehow coming to the table right now is making concessions to Vladimir Putin outright, that we otherwise—or that the president or the United States shouldn’t otherwise make—I just reject that at its face,” Hegseth [said](https://x.com/atrupar/status/1890068942246351108). “There’s a reason why negotiations are happening right now, just a few weeks after President Trump was sworn in as the president of the United States.

“President Putin responds to strength,” Hegseth added.

But that interpretation of events flies in the face of what the president’s former allies see in his negotiations with Putin. Speaking with CNN on Wednesday, Trump’s former national security adviser [John Bolton](https://newrepublic.com/post/191500/donald-trump-john-bolton-vladimir-putin-ukraine) claimed that Putin’s insistence on negotiating through Trump—rather than going through previous administrations or through Ukraine’s leaders directly—was simply because Putin believes “he’ll get more out of it.”  

“And he’s absolutely right,” Bolton [said](https://x.com/acyn/status/1889860559199412253).

NATO allies were left reeling Wednesday after Hegseth [pitched](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/ukraine-war-hegseth-nato.html) that America would effectively end its role as the steward of European security, revealing that the administration’s peace talks with Russia had taken several chips “off the table,” including Ukraine’s possible NATO membership (something the military alliance had promised in 2008), the possibility of a U.S. presence in Ukraine to enforce postwar security guarantees, and the end of NATO missions to Ukraine.

Hegseth also said Wednesday that Ukraine returning to its prewar borders—before Russia annexed Crimea in 2014—would be “unrealistic,” effectively forcing Ukraine to cede territory to Russia in another striking reversal of the U.S. and NATO’s previous position regarding the former Soviet territory.

The new deal, per Bolton, amounted to Russian propaganda and was practically “written in the Kremlin.”

It was a stunning show of inexperience for the former Fox News host, who apparently needed to walk back some of those brazen settlement terms while speaking before NATO on Thursday. Hegseth insisted that, despite the U.S. having already shown its hand, “everything is on the table” when it comes to arranging peace between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

“What he decides to allow or not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world, of President Trump,” Hegseth [said](https://x.com/nickschifrin/status/1890069901794255261) Thursday. “I’m not going to stand at this podium and declare what President Trump will do or won’t do.”

During an Oval Office press conference Thursday unveiling his new [“reciprocal tariff” plan](https://newrepublic.com/post/191518/donald-trump-global-trade-war-new-tariffs), Trump denied telling Hegseth to walk back his comments, describing them as “pretty accurate.”

But the futile backtrack earned him the ire of several national security and defense experts, who argued online that Hegseth had already ceded too much to Russia.

“Hegseth’s lack of experience is already showing,” [posted](https://x.com/shashj/status/1890075776743297271) *The Economist*’s defense editor, Shashank Joshi, on X. “Publicly makes a series of pre-emptive concessions prior to the most important negotiations in many years, and then has to publicly explain that he had no authority to say any of those things.”

Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman for President Barack Obama and the United States National Security Council, also torched Hegseth for the critical negotiating error.

“This was a huge fuckup by Hegseth,” Vietor [wrote](https://x.com/TVietor08/status/1890073342981599468). “There’s no walking back his initial comments that Ukraine won’t join NATO or gain back all the territory lost since 2014. He wrote Putin a big check that has already been cashed. Maybe don’t make an unqualified Fox News host @SecDef?”

Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency will soon be headed to an agency very close to his personal interests: NASA.

On Wednesday, the agency’s acting administrator Janet Petro told [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-12/musk-s-doge-workers-are-headed-to-nasa-for-spending-review) that NASA was expecting a visit from Musk’s DOGE cronies, saying that “they are going to look—similarly to what they’ve done at other agencies—at our payments.”

Musk’s company SpaceX is a major contractor with NASA, to the tune of about [$14.5 billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-doge-visit-elon-musk-spacex-jared-isaacman-2025-2), and has taken over transporting astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station. It is also under contract to build a vehicle to take humans back to the moon under NASA’s Artemis initiative.

Despite those contracts, Musk has repeatedly criticized the agency, calling the Artemis program “extremely inefficient” and missions to the moon “a distraction” from his own personal goal of [colonizing Mars](https://newrepublic.com/article/137269/elon-musk-insane-plan-create-colony-mars). SpaceX is already launching [multiple missions](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-spacex-plan-colonize-mars-dont-count-on-it-2024-9) to the red planet in the next decade, and the tech mogul–[fascism enthusiast](https://newrepublic.com/post/190464/did-elon-musk-nazi-salute-trump-inauguration) might want to shift the agency’s mission in that direction.

Musk might also take aim at NASA’s other contracts to serve his interests. Last year, for example, he [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-faa-should-punish-boeing-starliner-not-spacex-9) Boeing over its Starliner program. Some of the many young programmers in DOGE, such as [Luke Farritor](https://newrepublic.com/post/191319/doge-energy-department-nuclear-weapons) and [Marko Elez](https://newrepublic.com/post/191327/elon-musk-rehire-doge-staffer-racist-posts), already have connections to SpaceX.

Petro said that NASA’s conflict-of-interest policies would apply to DOGE operatives, saying that “any employee or any person that’s coming in, we will check out their conflict of interest, make sure they don’t have any conflicts of interest with any of the companies that we work with.” But Petro herself may soon be replaced by [Jared Isaacman](https://www.washingtonpost.com/post-next/interactive/2025/jared-isaacman/), an astronaut who has flown multiple missions for SpaceX, if he is confirmed by the Senate.

It’s highly doubtful that any conflict-of-interest policies anywhere in the federal government will be enforced against Musk. For example, a massive $400 million State Department contract for armored vehicles awarded to Tesla drew criticism, but the department only [responded](https://newrepublic.com/post/191493/tesla-name-delete-federal-contract-state-department) by removing the word “Tesla” from the contract. NASA could be where Musk’s most blatant self-serving actions take place.

Former WWE executive Linda McMahon faced [questioning from Senator Chris Murphy](https://www.c-span.org/event/senate-committee/education-sec-nominee-linda-mcmahon-testifies-at-confirmation-hearing/430797#!) during her Senate confirmation hearing Thursday regarding the specifics of her anti-DEI enforcement plans.

“West Point has closed down all ethnic clubs. So the Society of Black Engineers can no longer meet because they believe that to be in compliance with this order they cannot have groups structured around ethnic or racial affiliations,” the Connecticut senator began, referring to how the military academy [responded](https://newrepublic.com/post/191171/west-point-donald-trump-culture-wars-dei) to Trump’s executive order striking all diversity, equity, and inclusion programs from the federal government. “Would public schools be in violation of this order, would they risk funding if they had clubs that students could belong to based on their racial or ethnic identity?”

‘Well I certainly today don’t want to address … hypothetical situations,” McMahon said, sidestepping the question. “I would like, once I’m confirmed, to get in and assess these programs—”

“Isn’t that a pretty easy one?” Murphy interrupted. “You’re saying that it’s a possibility that if a school has a club for Vietnamese American students, or Black students, where they meet after school, that they could be potentially in jeopardy of receiving federal funding?”

“Again, I would like to fully understand what that order is and what those clubs are doing.”

“That’s pretty chilling,” Murphy said, in response to McMahon’s spineless attempt to avoid admitting that the Trump administration would regulate cultural clubs and activities. “I think schools all around the country are gonna hear that. What about educational programming centered around specific ethnic and racial experiences? My son is in a public school; he takes a class called African American history. If you’re running an African American history class, could you perhaps be in violation of this executive order?”

“I’m not quite certain,” McMahon said. “I’d like to look into it further and get back to you on that.”

“So there’s a possibility … that public schools that run African American history classes … a class that has been taught in school for decades, could lose federal funding if they continue to teach African American history?”

“No, that’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying that I would like to take a look at these programs and fully understand the breadth of the executive order and get back to you on that” McMahon desperately tried to backtrack.

She did not expound on exactly what “looking into” African American history programs entailed.

“I think you’re gonna have a lot of educators, and a lot of principals and administrators scrambling right now,” Murphy warned. “My time is expired.”
