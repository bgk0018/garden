During a visit to [El Salvador](https://www.latintimes.com/topics/el-salvador), Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) claimed that it's vice president told him the [Trump administration](https://www.latintimes.com/topics/trump-administration) is financially compensating the country to continue detaining Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia at CECOT.

Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who had been living legally in Maryland, was mistakenly deported by the U.S. government due to what officials later admitted was an "administrative error."

Although the Trump administration has labeled him as having gang ties, Abrego Garcia has not been convicted of any gang-related offenses, and both the U.S. courts and Salvadoran authorities have found no solid evidence linking him to MS-13. Nevertheless, he remains locked in Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT), a maximum-security prison in El Salvador meant for terrorists, according to [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/16/el-salvador-senator-mistakenly-deported-man).

On April 16, Van Hollen met with El Salvador Vice President Félix Ulloa and questioned why Abrego Garcia was still being held despite court rulings and lack of evidence. Ulloa allegedly told Van Hollen that the Trump administration is "paying" El Salvador to keep Garcia imprisoned at CECOT.

"His answer was that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador, the government of El Salvador to keep him at CECOT," Van Hollen said.

The senator also requested to see or speak with Garcia but was told no such visit could be arranged without advanced approval and coordination with the U.S. Embassy.

Van Hollen said he will now request the American Embassy to formally seek communication with Garcia, though there are no guarantees that access will be granted. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has reportedly told President Trump he won't release Garcia or return him to the U.S., despite court orders urging the U.S. government to facilitate his release.

Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has said that even if Garcia were to return, he would be detained again and deported.
