# Kafka Monitoring for Reliability

## Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Producer Metrics**
   - Error rate per record
   - Retry rate per record
   - Average request latency

2. **Consumer Metrics**
   - Consumer lag
   - Commit success rate
   - Rebalance events

3. **Broker Metrics**
   - Under-replicated partitions
   - Request handler utilization
   - Request timing

## Monitoring Tools

- JMX metrics from clients
- Burrow for consumer lag monitoring
- Confluent Control Center for end-to-end monitoring

## Best Practices

1. Monitor both client and broker metrics
2. Track message timestamps for end-to-end latency
3. Set up alerts for critical thresholds
4. Monitor failed request rates with error types
