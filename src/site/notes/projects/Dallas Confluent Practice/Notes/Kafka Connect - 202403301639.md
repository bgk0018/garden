When using plain JSON data with Connect, you see the following error message: org.apache.kafka.connect.errors.DataException: JsonDeserializer with schemas.enable requires "schema" and "payload" fields and may not contain additional fields. How will you fix the error?:: Set key.converter.schemas.enable and value.converter.schemas.enable to false

To continuously export data from Kafka into a target database, I should use:: Kafka Connect Sink is used to export data from Kafka to external databases and Kafka Connect Source is used to import from external databases into Kafka.
