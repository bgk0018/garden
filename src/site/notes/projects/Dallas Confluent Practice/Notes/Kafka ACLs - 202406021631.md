A producer application in a developer machine was able to send messages to a Kafka topic. After copying the producer application into another developer's machine, the producer is able to connect to Kafka but unable to produce to the same Kafka topic because of an authorization issue. What is the likely issue?:: The Kafka ACL does not allow another machine IP. ACLs take "Host" as a parameter, which represents an IP. It can be * (all IP), or a specific IP. Here, it's a specific IP as moving a producer to a different machine breaks the consumer, so the ACL needs to be updated
