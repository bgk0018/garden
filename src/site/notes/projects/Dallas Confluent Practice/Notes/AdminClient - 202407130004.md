# AdminClient

- AdminClient is a tool for managing and interacting with Apache Kafka clusters
- Useful for both application developers and operators/SREs
- Allows programmatic management of Kafka resources
- Can perform operations like topic management, configuration management, and consumer group management
- Provides methods for advanced operations like leader election and replica reassignment

## Specific Capabilities

### Topic Management

- Create, delete, and modify Kafka topics
- List existing topics
- Describe topic details (partitions, replicas, etc.)
- Expand topics by adding partitions

### Configuration Management

- Alter configurations for topics, brokers, and users
- Describe current configurations
- Incrementally modify configurations

### Consumer Group Management

- List and describe consumer groups
- Delete consumer groups

### Advanced Operations

- Leader election (preferred and unclean)
- Replica reassignment
- Delete records from a topic

## Testing

- MockAdminClient class available for unit testing
- Allows testing without running an actual Kafka cluster
