# Kafka Cluster Setup

## Kafka Cluster Size Discussions

- 1 Broker only good for dev
- 3 Brokers - Good for most cases
- 100 Brokers - Zookeeper probably under pressure, will likely need more zookeeper instances, likely have a full time team for managing cluster
- Only scale up when a bottleneck is reached

## Kafka Configuration

- Configuring Kafka in production is an 'art'
- It requires really good understanding of:
	- Operating Systems Architecture
	- Servers Architecture
	- Distributed Computing
	- CPU operations
	- Network perofrmance Disk I/O
	- RAM and Heap size
	- Page cache
	- Kafka and Zookeeper
- There are over 140 configuration parameters available for Kafka
	- Only a few parameters are needed to get started
	- Importance is classified between mandatory, high, medium, and low
- You will never get an optimal configuration the first time
- Configuration evolves over time

- Server Basics
	- `broker.id=1` The id of the broker, must be unique for each broker
	- `advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://kafka1:9092` change your.host.name by your machine's IP or hostname
	- `delete.topic.enable=true` swithc the enable topic deletion or not, default value is false
- Log Basics
	- `log.dirs=/data/kafka` a comma separated list of directories under which to store log files
	- `num.partitions=8` The default number of log partitions per topic
	- `default.replication.factor=3` we will have 3 brokers so the default replication factor should be 2 or 3
	- `min.insync.replicas=2` number of ISR to have in order to minimize data loss
- Log Retention Policy
	- `log.retention.hours=168` The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
	- `log.segment.bytes=123135245` The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created
	- `log.retention.check.interval.ms=30000` The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according to the retention policies
- Zookeeper
	- `zookeeper.connect=zookeeper1:2181,zookeeper2:2181,zookeeper3:2181/kafka` Zookeeper connection string with `chroot` string to the root directory for all kafka znodes
	- `zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000` Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
- Other
	- `auto.create.topics.enable=true` Set to false in production

## Hands On Single Kafka Broker Setup:

- Augment the file handle limits

## Advertised Listeners Setting

The most important setting of Kafka

Kafka Broker 1  
Public IP: 34.56.78.90  
Private IP: 172.31.9.1  
ADV_HOST=172.31.9.1

Basically the broker designates exactly what ip/hostname the broker wants you to use. If you designate that the advertised host is localhost or some other private IP that the client doesn't have access to, then the kafka client will fail to access the broker

The IPs need to be static.
