***UPDATE MARCH 2022: Course newly recorded with Kafka 3.0!***

*Welcome to the Apache Kafka Series! Join a community of 130,000+ students learning Kafka.*

**Apache Kafka** has become the leading **distributed data streaming** enterprise big data technology. Kafka is used in production by over 33% of the Fortune 500 companies such as Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, Walmart and LinkedIn.

**To learn Kafka easily, step-by-step, you have come to the right place! No prior Kafka knowledge is required**

\===============================

**If you look at the documentation, you can see that Apache Kafka is not easy to learn...**

Thanks to my several years of experience in Kafka and Big Data, I wanted to make learning Kafka accessible to everyone.

We'll take a step-by-step approach to learn all the fundamentals of Apache Kafka.  
At the end of this course, you'll be productive and you'll know the following:

- The Apache Kafka Ecosystem Architecture
- The Kafka Core Concepts: Topics, Partitions, Brokers, Replicas, Producers, Consumers, and more!
- Launch your own Kafka cluster in no time using native Kafka binaries – Windows / MacOS X / Linux
- Learn and Practice using the Kafka Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Code Producer and Consumers using the Java API
- Real world project using Wikimedia as a source of data for a producer and OpenSearch as a sink for our consumer
- Overview of Advanced APIs (Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams)
- Real World Case Studies and Big  Use cases
- Overview of Advanced Kafka for Administrators
- Advanced Topic Configurations

**Note:** The hands-on section is based on **Java**, which is the native Kafka programming language. But, good news! Your learning in Java will be completely applicable to other programming languages, such as Python, C#, Node.js or Scala, and Big Data frameworks such as Spark, NiFi or Akka

\===============================
