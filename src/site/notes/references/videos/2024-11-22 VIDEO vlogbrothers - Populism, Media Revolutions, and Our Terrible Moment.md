# Populism, Media Revolutions, and Our Terrible Moment

>[!summary]- Description
> This is one of those videos that you could just keep writing forever but I guess I recently had cause to decide to finish it. I waffle back and forth about whether we are on the quick path or the long path here. What seems clear is that, if all trust gets destroyed, reality starts to matter a little less and people pick the reality that the refer. What Renee DiResta calls "Bespoke Realities."

It's going to take time to put the pieces back together, but I do think that, when we do, it will be a better world. It's just that, most days, I think that's going to take forever.
