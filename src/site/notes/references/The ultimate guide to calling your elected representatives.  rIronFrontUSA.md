## TURN YOUR ANGER INTO ACTION: MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD EVERY DAY

If you’ve ever felt that politicians don’t listen or that your anger is being ignored, this guide will help you take direct action to force them to pay attention. The most effective way to do that? Direct phone calls.

#### Why Calls Matter More Than You Think

It’s easy to feel like your voice doesn’t matter—especially when the system seems rigged or when politicians appear to only listen to corporate donors. Here’s the reality: they do listen to voters—specifically, voters who won’t stop making noise. Right now, Republican voters have mastered this game.

Republicans are louder, more persistent, and more consistent when contacting their representatives. Studies, polls, and congressional staff reports show that Republicans outnumber Democrats in calls to Congress—sometimes by as much as 4 to 1 or even 11 to 1 on hot-button issues. And it’s not just about quantity; Republican callers tend to be more aggressive, make daily follow-up calls, and ensure their presence is unmistakable.

#### Why This Needs to Change

This imbalance has real consequences. When Republicans flood congressional offices with calls about issues like blocking gun safety laws or cutting healthcare funding, it influences how politicians vote. Even lawmakers who might be on the fence often lean right because they see overwhelming opposition from their constituents. That’s why Republican voter turnout, call volume, and persistence give them a massive advantage in today’s political climate.

**Example:** Imagine your representative is undecided on a key vote—say, expanding access to abortion. They receive 300 calls from anti-abortion activists and only 30 from pro-choice constituents. Even if the representative is personally pro-choice, the pressure to vote against expanding access can be overwhelming.

Right now, we’re facing critical battles on voting rights, reproductive healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights, climate change, gun reform, and the very nature of our democracy. We can’t afford to sit back while the loudest voices drown out the majority of Americans. We need to ensure that Democrats, Independents, and progressives are just as loud—or even louder.

#### How This Guide Will Help You Level the Playing Field

This guide will show you exactly how to:

- **Call both Democrats and Republicans** and tailor your message.
- **Adapt scripts** so your message resonates, even with conservative representatives.
- **Make calling a habit** that you and your friends can maintain.

*Optional:* When possible, attending town halls can be a great opportunity for face-to-face engagement—but remember, consistent phone calls are your most efficient tool.

## 1\. MAKE CALLING PART OF YOUR DAILY ROUTINE

**Phone calls are the most effective way to influence your representatives.** Here’s why:

- **Detailed Logs:** Staffers log every call by topic, location, and zip code.
- **Daily Reports:** Senior staff compile reports on the top issues being called about each day.
- **Direct Impact:** These reports are sent directly to elected officials, clearly showing which issues voters care about and where the pressure is coming from.

When representatives see a consistent surge in calls—especially from their own constituents—they pay attention. They know these calls represent votes, and that their jobs depend on responding to this pressure.

**Why Calls Work Better Than Emails or Letters:**

- **Immediate Impact:** Calls create real-time pressure. If a vote is imminent, a flood of calls can tip the balance.
- **Higher Visibility:** Emails often get filtered or ignored, and letters are too slow to effect immediate change.

## 2\. MAKE AT LEAST 6 CALLS A DAY

**Why 6 calls?** You want to target both the DC and local offices of your Senators (and, if applicable, your Representative) to ensure your message is heard on multiple levels. Depending on your district, there may be additional satellite offices you can call for even more impact.

Here’s the basic breakdown:

- **Senators:** Make 2 calls for each of your Senators—one to their DC office and one to their primary local office.

- Find their contact information: [Senators Contact List](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm)
- **Representative:** If applicable, make 2 calls to your Representative—one to their DC office and one to their primary local office.

- Find their contact information: [Find Your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
- **Additional Offices:** If your representatives have satellite offices, consider calling them as well. These offices log every call and report back to the main office, boosting your overall impact.
- **Bonus:** Call your **governor’s office** too! Governors often play key roles in enforcing or blocking state-level policies.

- Find your governor’s contact info: [State Governors](https://www.usa.gov/state-governor)

**More calls = more pressure.** If you have time to contact additional offices, don’t stop at 6.

## 3\. ORGANIZE YOUR CONTACTS FOR EFFICIENCY

1. **Label Your Contacts:**  
Save phone numbers in your phone with clear labels. For example:

- **P Sen \[First Name\] \[Last Name\] → Senator**
- **P Rep \[First Name\] \[Last Name\] → House Representative**
- **P Gov \[First Name\] \[Last Name\] → Governor**

This “P” tag groups all your political contacts together for easy access, and the role tags (Sen, Rep, Gov) help you quickly identify each contact.
2. **Include Office Locations:**  
Each office (DC, state, or district) will have its own phone number. Label them by location (e.g., “DC Office,” “Boston Office”) so you can quickly call the right one.
3. **Set a Daily Reminder:**  
Whether it’s during breakfast or on your lunch break, treat calling as a non-negotiable daily habit.

**Tip:** Even if you reach voicemail, leave a message. Staffers log every call.

**Bonus Tip:** If you feel anxious about talking on the phone, try calling after 5 pm when you’re more likely to reach an answering machine.

## 4\. USE 5 CALLS TO FIND ISSUES AND TARGETS

If you’re unsure which issues to prioritize or which offices to call, [**5 Calls**](https://5calls.org/) is your secret weapon. It’s designed to help you maximize the impact of your daily outreach. Consider adding their app to your phone’s home screen.

Here’s how it works:

- **Key Issues Automatically Listed:** It identifies the most urgent issues based on your location.
- **Comprehensive Contact Information:** It provides the names and phone numbers for your Senators, Representative, and governor.
- **Suggested Scripts:** It offers sample scripts for each issue so you can confidently get your point across.

**Tip:** If 5 Calls suggests an office you didn’t know about, save that number in your contacts for future calls.

With **consistent, strategic calling**, we can level the playing field and ensure our voices are just as loud—if not louder—than those on the other side.

## 5\. CRAFT AN EFFECTIVE SCRIPT FOR EACH CALL

**Preparation is key.** Before you dial, take a few moments to decide what you’re going to say—even if you’re using a script from 5 Calls. Here’s a simple template:

1. **Introduce Yourself:**

- Example: “Hi, my name is \[Your Name\], and I’m a constituent from \[Your City/State/Zip Code\].”
2. **State Your Purpose:**

- Example: “I’m calling to express my concern/support regarding \[specific bill, issue, or policy\].”
3. **Make It Personal:**

- Example: “As a teacher, I see firsthand how this bill will impact our schools.”
- OR: “As someone who lost a family member to gun violence, I’m asking you to vote for stricter background checks.”
4. **Be Clear About What You Want:**

- Example: “I urge the Senator to vote YES on \[Bill Number\].”
- OR: “I want the Representative to publicly oppose the proposed cuts to Medicare.”

#### Leave a Voicemail if Necessary

If you can’t reach a live person, leave a concise voicemail following the same script.

**Tip:** Practice your script out loud once or twice before calling. It helps you sound confident and clear.

## 6\. DON’T JUST CALL DEMOCRATS—CALL REPUBLICANS TOO

It’s tempting to only call representatives who share your views, but it’s just as important to call Republicans. In the current political landscape, every vote counts—even more so when Republicans are in the majority.

#### The Slim Majorities Mean Maximum Leverage

- **Tight Margins:** For example, Republicans are starting 2025 with the smallest House majority since 1931, with just enough seats to pass legislation.
- **Key Votes:** In the Senate, a few moderate Republicans may be persuaded to vote differently on critical issues. When Republicans are divided, every call can make a difference.

#### Why Republicans Track Every Call

Republican offices log every call—even from voters who don’t share their ideology. They care about the sheer volume of calls because it reflects potential voting power. Even if they disagree with your position, ignoring a large number of calls could jeopardize their seat.

#### How to Influence Republican Votes

You’re not trying to change their ideology; you’re showing that voting your way aligns with their interests. Emphasize that supporting your position can help them politically—whether by appealing to moderates or by showcasing bipartisan leadership.

## 7\. ADJUST YOUR MESSAGE FOR REPUBLICANS

If you’re speaking with a Republican representative, consider these strategies:

1. **Focus on Shared Values:**

- Emphasize economic benefits, public safety, family stability, and similar priorities.
2. **Frame Arguments Around Practical Concerns:**

- Republicans are more likely to respond to points about jobs, small businesses, taxes, national security, and community well-being.
- **Example:** “I’m concerned this policy will hurt small businesses by increasing costs.”
- **Example:** “Supporting this bill will help veterans by improving healthcare access and job opportunities.”
3. **Highlight the Political Advantage:**

- Stress how voting your way can help them win reelection by appealing to moderate voters or by demonstrating bipartisan cooperation.
- **Example:** “Supporting this bill shows you’re putting the community’s needs above party lines.”
4. **Consider Positioning Yourself as a Conservative Voter:**

- If it helps your case, you might frame yourself as a conservative who values fiscal responsibility or local economic growth.
- **Example:** “As a lifelong conservative, I believe in protecting our environment while also supporting local businesses.”

**Tip:** If you’re calling from a district that typically votes Republican, mention your zip code to reinforce that you’re part of their constituency.

## 8\. FOCUS ON 1-2 ISSUES PER CALL

When you call, narrow your focus to 1–2 specific issues. Staffers usually log only a couple of topics per call, so concentrate on the most pressing issue of the day:

- **Prioritize:** Focus on issues that are about to be voted on or are currently under debate.
- **Long-Term Focus:** If nothing urgent is happening, call about long-term challenges like climate change or healthcare reform.
- **Keep the Pressure On:** Even if you’ve called about the same issue before, continue until you see action.

**Tip:** Consistency is key—each call adds pressure.

## 9\. TURN PASSIVE SCROLLING INTO ACTIVE CALLING

Instead of posting a useless meme or comment, pick up the phone and make your calls. If you find yourself doomscrolling at 2 a.m. and getting pissed off, channel that frustration into action by calling your representatives. And if you see someone complaining that nothing can be done, share this guide with them and urge them to join in—every call counts.
