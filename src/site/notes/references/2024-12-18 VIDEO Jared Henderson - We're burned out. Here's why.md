We all feel burnout. So let's take some time to look at the psychology, philosophy, and anthropology behind burnout. We'll talk about psychologists like Herbert Freudenberger and philosophers Bertrand Russell and Byung-Chul Han to get to the bottom of this.

## Transcript

## Intro

0:00

burnout is on the rise in one survey 77%

0:03

of respondents said that they had felt

0:05

burned out at work people are quiet

0:08

quitting or they're just quitting their

0:09

jobs or they wish they could just drop

0:12

out of it all stop working and do

0:14

something that mattered instead we're

0:16

stressed we're anxious and we feel like

0:18

we just can't do this anymore so what is

0:21

burnout and why is it increasing well if

0:23

we want to answer that question we

0:24

should go and actually look at the

0:25

history of the word

0:28

\[Music\]

## What is Burnout

0:31

take a look at this chart the word

0:33

burnout doesn't really start appearing

0:34

in books until the 1950s and it doesn't

0:37

really take off in popularity until the

0:39

1980s that's when the psychologist

0:41

freudenberger published his book burnout

0:44

the high cost of high achievement

0:46

fredburger actually came up with this

0:48

concept by analyzing himself he was so

0:51

overcome with Stress and Anxiety that he

0:54

wasn't even able to get out of bed or

0:56

move at times he said that he couldn't

0:58

even feel Joy in one interview

1:00

freudenberger described burnout like

1:02

this burnout really is a response to

1:04

stress it's a response to frustration

1:06

it's a response to a demand that an

1:08

individual may make upon thems in terms

1:10

of a requirement for perfectionism or

1:12

drive now after freudenberg's work

1:14

psychologists started to get a bit more

1:15

rigorous in how they described burnout

1:17

the Yale psychologist Lori Santos breaks

1:19

it down into three parts you're burned

1:21

out when you feel emotionally exhausted

1:23

so you can't handle any more burdens the

1:26

metaphor that Santos uses is a house of

1:28

cards if there's even one more more

1:30

burden or one more piece of stress added

1:32

to your life the whole thing is going to

1:33

collapse the second sign is

1:35

depersonalization this is when you start

1:37

to be cynical you start to question

1:39

people's intentions and

1:41

depersonalization also gets in the way

1:42

of forming authentic human connections

1:45

and the third sign of burnout Santos

1:47

says is a sense of personal

1:49

ineffectiveness no matter what you do it

1:52

isn't going to matter you can't change

1:54

anything that last part I think is

1:55

really at the heart of the issue there's

1:57

a reason so many of us feel burned out

1:59

especially about work and it's because

2:02

we think we're working jobs that don't

2:05

matter that's an idea that was

2:06

popularized by the Anthropologist David

2:08

Graber Graber came up with a term for

2:10

these sorts of jobs which he calls

2:12

jobs and he defines a

2:14

job as a form of paid employment that is

2:16

so completely pointless unnecessary or

2:19

pernicious that even the employee cannot

2:21

justify its existence even though as

2:23

part of the conditions of employment the

2:25

employee feels obliged to pretend this

2:27

is not the case and this idea of Graber

2:30

it really resonated with people Graber

2:33

put this idea out there in a really

2:35

small online magazine called strike and

2:37

when it was released it went viral I

2:39

think something like a million people

2:41

read the article and actually the

2:43

Magazine's website couldn't keep up and

2:44

ended up crashing when Graber was

2:46

describing these pointless jobs

2:48

well people thought that reflected their

2:51

experiences in one ugv poll 37% of

2:54

people said that their jobs were

2:56

meaningless or specifically they said

2:58

their jobs weren't contributing meaning

2:59

mean f to society so we don't lose sight

3:02

of the plot here let me break out how a

3:04

job might be related to burnout

3:06

burnout seems to partly stem from a

3:07

sense of futility like nothing that you

3:10

do matters or can change anything well

3:12

if you spend 8 hours a day which is a

3:15

huge part of your waking hours working a

3:17

job that you think doesn't accomplish

3:18

anything then it's not hard to see how

3:20

you would think that in general your

3:22

life is futile no matter what you do

3:25

nothing's going to change and nothing's

3:27

going to get better Graber is often

3:29

criticized for some of the examples that

3:31

he gives for jobs like

3:33

actuaries turns out actually an actuary

3:35

is kind of a useful job and it might

3:37

even be the case that actuaries think

3:38

that their jobs are quite useful so they

3:40

don't really meet the conditions of

3:42

being a job like graper would

3:44

say but some sociologists have tried to

3:45

find empirical support for graber's

3:47

thesis and they found something a lot of

3:49

people do think their jobs are

3:51

it's just not the jobs that Graber

3:53

expected it's people often who work in

3:55

things like Transportation or shipping

3:57

these are jobs that are characterized by

3:59

monotony no matter what you do you're

4:00

going to basically do the same thing

4:02

tomorrow you do the same thing over and

4:05

over and over and over and over and

4:09

over I actually once had a seasonal job

## Seasonal Jobs

4:12

working at UPS uh my whole job was to

4:16

grab packages as they were coming down a

4:18

conveyor belt and then put them onto

4:20

trucks and there's something really

4:21

strange about the fact that you'll do

4:23

this for a few hours and you'll still

4:26

see this endless flow of packages coming

4:29

it's like as if you barely put a dent in

4:31

it despite the fact that you're tired

4:32

and you feel sore and later on when I

4:34

went to work at some tech companies I

4:36

actually often felt the same cuz it felt

4:38

like we were always bouncing from

4:40

Project to project or we all had to

4:42

pretend that we were excited about some

4:43

big new corporate initiative even though

4:46

like we all knew it wasn't going to make

4:47

a difference oh great they've come up

4:49

with like some brand new metric in order

4:51

to measure our performance but it turns

4:53

out everything's exactly the same it's

4:55

just that the format of my quarterly

4:57

evaluation has changed slightly and we

4:59

all have to pretend like it matters

5:00

everyone that I knew and talked to about

5:01

this was very cynical even if management

5:04

sort of wanted us to pretend otherwise

5:06

we were all like Copus but instead of

5:08

pushing Boulders up a hill we were

5:12

sitting behind laptops and going to

5:13

meetings and kind of just getting by and

5:18

at least a lot of people that I knew

5:20

they felt burned out and they felt

5:21

burned out because we felt like we

5:23

weren't ever accomplishing something of

## Our Burnout Society

5:25

course burnouts not just limited to our

5:28

jobs it can actually in

5:30

all of our lives and that's because as

5:33

one philosopher puts it we live in a

5:35

burnout

5:36

Society that's the title of this book by

5:39

the philosopher B CH Han despite this

5:41

being a really short book Han's ideas

5:43

are quite dense and so I just feel

5:46

compelled to pause the video and say hey

5:48

you should go and read this book you

5:50

could probably read it in an afternoon

5:51

and get a sense of it and it'll do more

5:53

for you than watching this YouTube video

5:56

at the core of Hans analysis is this

5:57

idea that we live in an achievement

5:59

Society in this Society we are

6:01

constantly striving to do more we want

6:04

to achieve more we want to produce more

6:07

and on top of that we always feel like

6:10

we have to think positively about it so

6:13

Han says that the root of our problem

6:14

isn't negativity it it's actually excess

6:18

positivity now if you take a quick look

6:21

at some management websites when they

6:22

talk about burnout they always tell you

6:24

to just change your mindset and try to

6:26

be more optimistic about the future but

6:28

if Han is right that is exactly wrong

6:31

it's actually that kind of forced

6:32

positivity that makes us feel more

6:34

burned out in the long run and that's

6:36

really similar to what freudenberger

6:37

said at the top of the video it's that

6:39

drive towards perfectionism achievement

6:42

and productivity we never let ourselves

6:44

stop being productive we always want to

6:46

do more in fact even when we do things

6:48

for fun we often rationalize it or

6:51

justify it because we say it's going to

6:52

recharge our batteries so that then we

6:54

can go back and do even better work the

6:57

philosopher bertran Russell puts it this

6:59

way the modern man thinks that

7:00

everything ought to be done for the sake

7:02

of something else and never for its own

7:04

sake and Han and Russell following in a

7:07

long line of philosophers would say that

7:09

if we want to counteract burnout and

7:11

this sense of futility in the world we

7:13

have to learn how to be idle again we

7:16

like to use idleness as an insult we say

7:18

things like Idle Hands are the devil's

7:20

workshop but in the ancient world like

7:22

say in the world of Aristotle Plato

7:25

idleness was actually seen as important

7:28

to a good life because when you're Idol

7:30

that's when you have time to contemplate

7:33

and contemplation is the best kind of

7:35

Life at least According to Aristotle now

7:37

for someone like Aristotle contemplation

7:39

basically meant being like a philosopher

7:41

scientist for many people that's not

7:43

their idea of the best sort of life but

7:45

buron wrestle has a slightly broader

7:47

view of what one could do in your idle

7:49

time it's when you're free from the

7:51

necessity of work where you don't have

7:52

to work in order to meet your needs or

7:54

to live a decent life and you also don't

7:56

feel driven to do anything except for

7:58

its own sake you just end up doing

8:00

things that matter because they matter

8:02

some people would just use all of their

8:04

Idol time their Leisure Time To Have Fun

8:07

more to relax but Russell thought that

8:10

for a lot of people they would use it to

8:12

explore the universe or to produce great

8:14

art or to perfect their craft because

8:17

they cared about it they'd be able to

8:18

look at what they were doing and they

8:20

could see that it was good and thus they

8:23

wouldn't really feel burnout it just

8:25

wouldn't apply doesn't mean they

8:26

couldn't get frustrated it's just that

8:28

burnout wouldn't really apply but in our

8:30

world that's hard to do you know B Johan

8:33

says that we need to learn to be bored

8:35

and it turns out just sitting around and

8:37

being bored is really hard when we're so

8:40

used to a world of constant stimulation

8:42

and a world of constant productivity but

8:45

maybe learning how to be bored is that

8:47

first step towards learning how to be

8:49

Idol and actually using our time well

8:52

for things that matter now this video
