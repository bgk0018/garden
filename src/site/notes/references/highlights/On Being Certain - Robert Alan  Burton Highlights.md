>Despite how certainty feels, it is neither a conscious choice nor even a thought process. Certainty and similar states of “knowing what we know” arise out of involuntary brain mechanisms that, like love or anger, function independently of reason.

# The Feeling of Knowing

---
>[!QUOTE]
>EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR with the most commonly recognized feeling of knowing. When asked a question, you feel strongly that you know an answer that you cannot immediately recall. Psychologists refer to this hard-to-describe but easily recognizable feeling as a tip-of-the-tongue sensation. The frequent accompanying comment as you scan your mental Rolodex for the forgotten name or phone number: “I know it, but I just can’t think of it.” In this example, you are aware of knowing something, without knowing what this sense of knowing refers to. ([133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=133))

>[!QUOTE]
>At this simplest level of understanding, there are two components to our understanding—the knowledge that 2 + 2 = 4, and the judgment or assessment of this understanding. ([144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=144))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>At a deeper level, most of us have agonized over those sickening “crises of faith” when firmly held personal beliefs are suddenly stripped of a visceral sense of correctness, rightness, or meaning. Our most considered beliefs suddenly don’t “feel right.” Similarly, most of us have been shocked to hear that a close friend or relative has died unexpectedly, and yet we “feel” that he is still alive. Such upsetting news often takes time to “sink in.” This disbelief associated with hearing about a death is an example of the sometimes complete disassociation between intellectual and felt knowledge. ([149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=149))

>[!QUOTE]
>The kite paragraph raises several questions central to our understanding of how we “know” something. Though each will be discussed at greater length in subsequent chapters, here’s a sneak preview.   • Did you consciously “decide” that kite was the correct explanation for the paragraph, or did this decision occur involuntarily, outside of conscious awareness?   • What brain mechanism(s) created the shift from not knowing to knowing?   • When did this shift take place? (Did you know that the explanation was correct before, during, or after you reread the paragraph?)   • After rereading the paragraph, are you able to consciously separate out the feeling of knowing that kite is the correct answer from a reasoned understanding that the answer is correct?   • Are you sure that kite is the correct answer? If so, how do you know? ([171](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=171))

## Cognitive Dissonance

---
>[!QUOTE]
>In 1957, Stanford professor of social psychology Leon Festinger introduced the term cognitive dissonance to describe the distressing mental state in which people “find themselves doing things that don’t fit with what they know, or having opinions that do not fit with other opinions they hold.” ([249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=249))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The more committed we are to a belief, the harder it is to relinquish, even in the face of overwhelming contradictory evidence. Instead of acknowledging an error in judgment and abandoning the opinion, we tend to develop a new attitude or belief that will justify retaining it.

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Although not restricted to a single area of the brain or a single definitive physiology, the most striking shared characteristic of these delusional misidentification syndromes is that the conflict between logic and a contrary feeling of knowing tends to be resolved in favor of feeling. Rather than rejecting ideas and beliefs that defy common sense and overwhelming contrary evidence, such patients end up using tortured logic to justify the more powerful sense of knowing what they know.8 ([317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=317))

# Conviction Isn’t a Choice

---
>[!QUOTE]
>“Mystical truth … resembles the knowledge given to us in sensations more than that given by conceptual thought.”4 James’s description is perfectly straightforward—with mystical states, people experience spontaneous mental sensations that feel like knowledge but occur in the absence of any specific knowledge. Felt knowledge. Knowledge without thought. Certainty without deliberation or even conscious awareness of having had a thought. ([394](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=394))

## Neurotheology

## Voices from the Limbic System

>[!QUOTE]
>LeDoux’s experiments greatly clarified the role of the amygdala in evoking a fear response without the need for any conscious awareness and recognition of the provoking stimulus.17 Other experiments have confirmed that direct stimulation of the amygdala produces the same fear response as Ledoux’s conditioning experiments. Conversely, bilateral removal of the amygdala in animals, from rats to monkeys, produces a state of utter fearlessness. ([473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=473))

# The Classification of Mental States

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Psychologists commonly divide certain feeling states into primary emotions, such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust,2 and secondary or social emotions, such as embarrassment, jealousy, guilt, and pride. ([567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=567))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>There is no body of neurological literature demonstrating the isolated absence of pride or gratitude as the result of localized brain injuries. Such emotions do not appear to be primary any more than magenta is a primary color. They are the end product of other more elemental mental states. ([579](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=579))

>Psychologists have recently begun to consider the role of pathological certainty and pathological uncertainty as they relate to schizophrenia and OCD. ([614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=614))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>By using these criteria of universality—relatively discrete anatomic localization and easy reproducibility without conscious cognitive input—the feeling of knowing and its kindred feelings should be considered as primary as the states of fear and anger.

## Modules

---
>[!QUOTE]
>A cell might respond to a particular shape but not another. A cluster of these highly individualized neurons specific to a single visual function is referred to as a module. ([815](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=815))

---
## The Hierarchical Arrangement of Sensory Data

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Your retina detects an orange-and-black fluttering. The information is sent to the primary visual cortex. Each category of module gathers its own particular data (such as the detection of vertical or horizontal motion, color, shape, and size). No single module can create a visual image. Rather the output of each flows into higher order networks within the visual association areas where it merges with a host of inputs from nonvisual circuitry—the ([818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=818))

---
## Emergence

---
>[!QUOTE]
>A classical example of emergence is how termites with their tiny brains are able to construct huge mounds up to twenty-five feet in height. No termite has a clue how or why to build a mound; its brain isn’t large enough to carry the information. ([843](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=843))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Somehow the interaction of lower-level capabilities produces a higher-level activity.3 The same process applies to the human brain. Each neuron is like a termite. It cannot contain a complete memory or hold an intelligent discussion. There are no superneurons, nor is there a master plan contained within each neuron. Each neuron’s DNA provides general instructions for how a cell operates and relates with other cells; it does not provide instructions for logic, reason, or poetry. And yet, out of this mass of cells comes Shakespeare and Newton. Consciousness, intentionality, purpose, and meaning all emerge from the interconnections between billions of neurons that do not contain these elements. ([846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=846))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Modularity, when combined with a schematic hierarchical arrangement of increasingly complex layers of neural networks and the concept of emergence, serves as an excellent working model for how the brain builds up complex perceptions, thoughts, and behavior. ([854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=854))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Consider the myriad components involved in the acquisition of language, ranging from the visual recognition of symbols and auditory processing of spoken sounds (phonemes) to the sorting out of nuance and implied irony. A racial epithet can be an accusation or a term of endearment, depending upon circumstance, facial expression, body language, and intonation. (Comedian George Carlin has made a career out of forcing us to hear politically loaded words from unanticipated angles.) In the interpretation of a single word, large areas of widely separated but interconnected cortex function as a behavioral unit—hence the applicability of the term module. ([870](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=870))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The feeling of knowing is universal, most likely originates within a localized region of the brain, can be spontaneously activated via direct stimulation or chemical manipulation, yet cannot be triggered by conscious effort. These arguments for its inclusion as a primary brain module are more compelling than those postulated for deceit, compassion, forgiveness, altruism, or Machiavellian cunning. ([882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=882))

---
## Synesthesia

---
>[!QUOTE]
>synesthesia is commonly thought to represent an involuntary comingling of two normally unrelated sensory modalities, such as sight and sound. Those affected experience two separate sensations as a single unit; they cannot willfully suppress the second sensory input. ([893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=893))

---
## Private Islands

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Synesthesia offers a startling insight: Lower-level brain modules can profoundly affect not only our ordinary sensory perceptions but also how we experience abstract symbols such as letters and numbers. If thought is the manipulation of words and symbols, we need to consider whether our very building blocks of thought might also be subject to involuntary, even genetic, influences that make each of us “private islands” of perception and thinking.

## Timing, or the Chicken and the Newly Hatched Idea

---
>[!QUOTE]
>To have unconditional trust that a feeling of knowing represents a justifiable conclusion, we need to know which of these three scenarios has actually occurred. Timing is everything. But what if the brain contains mechanisms that rearrange the perception of a sequence of events? What if our brains can trick us into believing that event X follows event Y, even though it actually precedes it? Sounds like a preposterous proposition, but what if this rearrangement is necessary to overcome yet other physiological barriers to the proper perception of a sequence of events?

>Here’s the windup, and here’s the thought. The listener’s decision as to the thought’s correctness will be based upon a quick glimpse of the idea leaving the other’s lips, snap judgments of body language, sighs, gestures, facial expressions, and all the various verbal and nonverbal contributions to interpretation of the spoken word. If the listener is forced to make a quick response, the decision as to the thought’s correctness will be subject to the same physiological restraints as a batter’s assessment of an incoming pitch. Nevertheless, due to the subjective backward referral of time, the listener will feel that he fully considered the idea before deciding on its correctness (the equivalent of Barry Bonds believing that he can see the ball in a quarter-sized strike zone before initiating his swing).

# Perceptual Thoughts: A Further Clarification

## Episodic Versus Semantic Memory

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Semantic memories include everything from the date and time of the attack on Pearl Harbor and the number of home runs hit by Babe Ruth to your present address and social security number. These are the packets of concrete information that can be externally verified and agreed upon. ([1156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=1156))

# The Pleasure of Your Thoughts

## The Pleasure Principle

>Thoughts have become more complex and abstract; much of what we think about today has no clear answer, no obvious cause-and-effect result, and isn’t easily measurable. We can never know with certainty whether decisions to invade Iraq, to restrict stem cell research, or to permit private ownership of handguns are the best decisions. The law of unforeseen consequences tells us that today’s seemingly positive result might be next decade’s catastrophe. ([1255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=1255))

>In order to pursue a new thought, we must feel the thought is worth pursuing before we have any supporting evidence or justification. Otherwise, we would only consider ideas we already know to be correct. But what would the reward be for a new or unique idea? We talk of the pleasure of knowledge for knowledge’s sake, but this presumes that what you are acquiring is bona fide knowledge. Proceeding without any sense of a thought’s value isn’t a high-priority activity. Just watch your kid avoid his homework, complaining bitterly that studying Latin or logic is worthless. “What’s the point?” is nothing more than thought’s reward system switched to off (or running on empty if you prefer the neurochemical metaphor).

# Genes and Thought

## Alice in Genetic Wonderland, or Through Hyperbole’s Looking Glass

>What you can’t know is how the gene affected his thoughts in undetectable ways. An additional piece of history is that the husband’s prior two marriages ended in bitter divorces with both departing wives accusing him of being cowardly, consumed with anxiety, and filled with self-doubt. His self-esteem is lower than his remaining Enron shares. The decision when to leave for the airport kicks his genetic predisposition to be fearful into overdrive, but not in a single direction. He is faced with two competing sets of disaster probabilities—getting to the airport late and missing the flight versus upsetting his new bride by revealing his cowardly neurotic ways. Both risk-reward probabilities are inputted into his hidden layer where they silently duke it out. If the fear of rejection is greater than missing the plane, the husband will quickly agree with his wife. ([1532](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=1532))

# Sensational Thoughts

>As an isolated system, thought is doomed to the perpetual “yes, but,” that arises out of not being able to know what you don’t know. Without a circuit breaker, indecision and inaction would rule the day. What is needed is a mental switch that stops infinite ruminations and calms our fears of missing an unknown superior alternative. Such a switch can’t be a thought or we would be back at the same problem. The simplest solution would be a sensation that feels like a thought but isn’t subject to thought’s perpetual self-questioning. ([1711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=1711))

## Intuition and Gut Feelings Are Unconscious Thoughts Plus the Feeling of Knowing

>Thoughts require sensory information. A disembodied mind cannot contemplate beauty or feel the differences between deep love, infatuation, and pure lust. To avoid confusion and chaos, our brains have sensory systems that selectively tell us when we are thinking a thought. These sensory systems also determine how we experience mental cause-and-effect and intentionality. And they are instrumental in imbuing our thoughts with a sense of their correctness or incorrectness.

Scientific inquiry requires this same piece of mind to objectively weigh evidence. Without this belief, the feeling of knowing wouldn’t feel like knowing.

Talking about the impossibility of a rational mind generates this general category in the same way that an atheist needs the concept of God in order to refute it.

>Our reluctance to face the problems of the rational mind stems in part from the feeling that the mind isn’t of the same category as the body. We don’t expect to jump twenty feet high or to swim underwater for a week; we can easily feel our physical limitations. But we don’t feel the same limits on our thoughts. For example, you feel free to accept or reject this paragraph. Acknowledging all the subliminal factors that influence this decision doesn’t override the more powerful feeling that you are in control of your thoughts. In essence, we are programmed to believe in bootstrap theories of improving our minds. Our mental limitations prevent us from accepting our mental limitations.

>[!QUOTE]
>Good science is more than the mechanics of research and experimentation. Good science requires that scientists look inward—to contemplate the origin of their thoughts. The failures of science do not begin with flawed evidence or fumbled statistics; they begin with personal self-deception and an unjustified sense of knowing. Once you adopt the position that personal experience is the “proof of the pudding,” reasoned discussion simply isn’t possible. Good science requires distinguishing between “felt knowledge” and knowledge arising out of testable observations. “I am sure” is a mental sensation, not a testable conclusion.

## Welcome to the F Word

>[!QUOTE]
>Whether or not it is appropriate to use the word faith to describe a feeling of “now I know why I’m here,” or “this must be what it’s all about,” it is impossible to overlook the shared qualities of the feeling of knowing, a sense of faith, and feelings of purpose and meaning. All serve as both motivation and reward at the most basic level of thought. ([2426](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=2426))

## Tolstoy and the Biology of Despair

>We don’t browbeat depressed patients to “get over it” because we are willing to accept that brain chemistry aberrations somehow result in a loss of a sense of meaning. But when a sense of purpose and meaning is present, it isn’t normally described as arising out of properly functioning neural mechanisms. Instead, purpose and meaning are discussed in metaphysical or religious terms. ([2455](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=2455))

## Caution: Deconstruction Zone Ahead

---
>[!QUOTE]
>How different the science-religion controversy would be if we acknowledged that a deeply felt sense of purpose is as necessary as hunger and thirst—all are universally necessary for survival and homeostasis. How we express these sensations will be a matter of personal taste and predilection. ([2500](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=2500))

>[!QUOTE]
>To expect well-reasoned arguments to easily alter personal expressions of purpose is to misunderstand the biology of belief. If there is to be any rapprochement between science and religion, both sides must accept this basic limitation. ([2510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=2510))

>Randomness is an observation; it isn’t evidence against a higher-order design. If I want my garden to look like a jungle, my best chance is to let the plants crawl all over one another. The garden may look like utter chaos, but that was my intent. Perhaps we are a well-designed experiment in futility. ([2548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003J5UJHW&location=2548))
