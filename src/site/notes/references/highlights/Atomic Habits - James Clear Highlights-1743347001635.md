## 1 The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

>[!QUOTE]
>Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. ([252](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=252))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. ([261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=261))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. ([280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=280))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. ([284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=284))

>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. ([289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=289))

>[!QUOTE]
>The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. ([307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=307))

## 2 How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. ([431](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=431))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change. ([439](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=439))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. ([441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=441))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level. ([443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=443))

---
>[!QUOTE]

>[!QUOTE]
>The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become. ([449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=449))

>Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. ([463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=463))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are. ([471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=471))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. ([480](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=480))

>[!QUOTE]
>When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse.

>[!QUOTE]
>The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. ([570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=570))

>The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. ([576](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=576))

>Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits. ([583](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=583))

## 3 How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

---
>[!QUOTE]
>A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. ([613](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=613))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming. ([622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=622))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>“Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.” ([625](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=625))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. ([632](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=632))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. ([634](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=634))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. ([650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=650))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. ([656](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=656))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. ([662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=662))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving. ([668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=668))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it. Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple, but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it. ([670](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=670))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. ([674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=674))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive. ([676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=676))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle. ([679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=679))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>This cycle is known as the habit loop. ([694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=694))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire. ([698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=698))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>I refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones. ([756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=756))

---
>[!QUOTE]
>Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote control next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness.

And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one. Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
