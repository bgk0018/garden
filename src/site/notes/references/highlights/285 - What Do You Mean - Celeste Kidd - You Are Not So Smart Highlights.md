>1. Individuals do not necessarily have the same subjective experiences when thinking about the same concept, such as penguins. Research suggests there is a low probability, around 12%, that the subjective experiences of different individuals align when it comes to concepts like penguins. This implies that personal thoughts, feelings, imaginations, and memories related to a certain concept, like penguins, vary greatly among individuals.

>[!QUOTE]  
>Individual Subjective Experiences of Concepts
>Summary:
>Individuals do not necessarily have the same subjective experiences when thinking about the same concept, such as penguins.
>Research suggests there is a low probability, around 12%, that the subjective experiences of different individuals align when it comes to concepts like penguins. This implies that personal thoughts, feelings, imaginations, and memories related to a certain concept, like penguins, vary greatly among individuals.
>Transcript:
>Speaker 1
>That sounds about right.
>Speaker 2
>It's about that. More often than not, when you think of penguin, and I think of penguin, we are not activating the exact same concept.
>Speaker 1
>When you think about penguins, and when I think about penguins, and dear listener, whoever you are, whatever you're thinking about when it comes to penguins, there's an assumption That if we all sat down and sort of talking about how much we like penguins or how cute they are, that we all have the same thing happening in our brains. And your research suggests that's about a 12% chance that that's actually happening. Very likely, it's super likely, it's almost certain that we are not actually having the same subjective experience of feeling, thinking, imagining, and remembering penguins.
>Speaker 2
>That is correct. There's further evidence of exactly why in the paper. So we did a second study where we looked to see, given that we can now quantify that your penguin and my penguin are probably not the same penguin concept.
