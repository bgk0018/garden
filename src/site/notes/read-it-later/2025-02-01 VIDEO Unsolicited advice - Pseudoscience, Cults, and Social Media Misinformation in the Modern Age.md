## Pseudoscience and Misinformation

0:00

we live in an unprecedented age of information and misinformation of scientific breakthroughs and

0:06

pseudoscientific nonsense it has never been more vital to ask how do we ensure

0:13

we do not fall for all the lies and that we make the most of what the modern

0:18

information landscape has to offer I believe we can take our lessons from an

0:24

unlikely Source we can look at pseudo scientists and Cults to see exactly how

0:30

they fool people into believing absurdities and how many of those Dynamics are worryingly replicated on

0:37

the internet today we'll be looking at astrology apocalyptic religions and

0:43

certain social media influences to see what each of them can teach us about how to spread nonsense as quickly and

0:50

effectively as possible and how we can move past these disturbing Trends into a

0:56

new way of approaching this dizzying world of endless information before we

1:02

get started I want to remind you all more than ever not to take what I say

1:08

here uncritically I am just proposing one way of looking at these issues it is

1:13

not the only one it is certainly not a perfect one and I fully encourage you to

1:19

build correct and refine it let's begin by looking at the fascinating history of

1:24

pseudo science and how philosophers and scientists have attempted to study and

1:30

Define it but if you want to avoid misinformation or pseudo science in your

1:35

newsfeed then you should check out today's very kind sponsor ground news ground news is a website and app that

1:42

gathers related articles from thousands of sources around the world in one place so you can compare how different Outlets

1:49

cover the same story each story comes with a clear breakdown of the political bias factuality ownership and headlines

1:56

of the reporting sources with ratings backed by independent news monitoring organizations grounds news are very

2:03

kindly offering anyone who uses my link or scans my QR code 40% off their

2:08

Vantage plan as a special deal so I highly encourage you to snap this up for instance let's see how the left and

2:14

right-wing Publications differed on the recent reports that the US economy grew by an annual rate of 2.3% in the last

2:21

quarter of 2024 while the rights was enthusiastic emphasizing how consumer spending had risen considerably leftwing

2:28

sources were much less optimistic suggesting growth is likely to slow in the first quarter of 2025 I especially

2:35

like the blind spot feed which highlights stories that are disproportionately covered by the left or the right this field helps readers

2:42

step into the other side's news reality and understand the different narratives that can shape their beliefs such as

2:48

left-wing news sources missing the accusations that the Chicago mayor has mishandled gifts or right-wing sources

2:54

not covering the Fallout from Trump's temporary freeze of a large amount of public spending I I don't have a lot of

3:00

time to keep up with the news and certainly not to examine every article I read for bias so ground news is

3:07

fantastic for giving me an idea of the differences in reporting on different stories so that I can get a variety of

3:13

views rather than just remaining stuck in my echo chamber ground news is very kindly giving my viewers 40% off their

3:20

unlimited access Vantage plan so please do check it out I think ground news is doing very important work and I'm very

3:26

happy to have them as a sponsor anyway back to the video one pseudo science a

## Pseudoscience: A Brief Introduction

3:32

brief introduction in a 1964 US Supreme Court case Justice Potter Stewart had to

3:39

Define what obscenity meant in a legal context and he famously gave the laconic reply I know it when I see it and a lot

3:48

of scientists and philosophers have very similar intuitions about pseudo science they look at Fields like young Earth

3:55

creationism or astrology and they instinctively call them pseudoscience ific but most attempts to Define

4:02

necessary and sufficient conditions for what counts as pseudo science have ultimately failed just to warn you we'll

4:09

be covering an awful lot of ground in this section but I promise it will all be important later in the video the

4:15

study of pseudo science as we know it began with the philosopher KL popper who separated science from pseudo science

4:22

with his falsifiability Criterion he thought that a statement was pseudoscientific if it did not make

4:28

predictions that could be proven false and thus ultimately falsify the theory the example he used was Albert

4:34

Einstein's prediction that certain distortions of light waves would be observed during an upcoming solar

4:39

eclipse because that was what his theory of general relativity had predicted Einstein effectively put his thesis on

4:47

the line if the requisite distortions were not observed then he would have to admit that his theory was partly or

4:54

wholly falsified this was the very thing POA did not observe in pseudo science

5:00

for example often times astrological charts make predictions that are so vague they can fit almost any set of

5:06

experiences take an excerpt from my horoscope in the UK newspaper the Metro on the day I'm writing this video new

5:14

ideas may come out of nowhere offering unique solutions to challenges you've been pondering if you solve any problem

5:22

even a tiny one then this horoscopees prediction has come true its claims are

5:27

so vague that they become effectively unfalsifiable the entire statement is even framed as a mere possibility new

5:34

ideas may come out of nowhere is trivially true it is basically always the case unless I'm in a coma or a

5:41

recently deceased in which case I'm very unlikely to have read the horoscope however Poppa's definition ultimately

5:48

has a couple of significant flaws the first is that it excludes statements most people would still call pseudo

5:55

scientific a creationist theory of life does make certain predictions

6:00

it predicts that species will not change over time and that there will not be a carbon dated fossil record that goes

6:06

back more than a few thousand years it is just that these statements have been falsified it seems the problem isn't

6:13

necessarily that the statements are unfalsifiable but how people react to the statement's falsification do they

6:19

accept it or do they unjustifiably reject it put a pin in this because in

6:24

about 2 minutes time it's going to be very important at the same time sometimes we who rejects the supposed

6:30

falsification of scientific theories for very good reasons when irregularities were observed in the orbit of Uranus

6:38

this technically falsified the predictions of newtonium mechanics but it was such a successful theory that the

6:44

physicists of the time said another planet must exist behind Uranus and interfere with its orbit as it turns out

6:51

they were right and the planet Neptune was later discovered of course newtonia mechanics did not turn out to be wholly

6:58

true but it's still doesn't seem quite right to say that the physicists engaged in pseudo science here another fun

7:05

example is a set of experiments in 1933 which claimed to discover that the speed

7:10

of light was not constant but varied according to direction if true this

7:15

would disprove special relativity however the theory was not immediately rejected despite no one at the time

7:22

being able to justifiably dismiss the results it was only in the 1950s that

7:27

the results were eventually explained by variations in temperature interfering with the measuring instruments if we

7:33

took falsification at face value then all of the research in special relativity between 1933 and 1955 was

7:41

pseudo science but that just seems untenable and moreover I don't think POA

7:46

would want to endorse this either the repeated failures to create a perfect definition for pseudoscience eventually

7:53

led the philosopher Larry lden to declare the quest dead in 1983 but a lot

7:58

of people in including myself think that this was premature just because we can't

8:03

set up an infallible dividing line between science and pseudoscience does not mean that there are no clear

8:10

examples of pseudo science out there and it's important to be able to clearly and justifiably label pseudo science because

8:17

believing in it can do real damage the philosophers John Dupre and mimo Puchi

8:23

and God I apologize to the nation of Italy for how I pronounce that have argued that we can think of pseudo

8:29

science as a cluster concept where different pseudo Sciences hold different criteria to a greater or lesser extent

8:36

it's a bit like how we don't have an airtight definition of sports but we can still say that basketball is a sport and

8:42

napping is not one and we can still come up with various deible criteria for whether a given activity is a sport

8:48

Martin manner has suggested a series of criteria for whether something is pseudo science including whether the results of

8:55

experiments can be independently reproduced whether the theories make specific predictions and whether they employ valid

9:01

argumentative structures these all aim at the statements and theories themselves to see if they hold up to

9:08

scrutiny additionally one of the recent developments in pseudoscience studies has been to focus on how communities of

9:15

pseudo scientists behave and to examine their internal methodology and I think this is a very promising line of

9:22

research NOA coer observes a key sociological difference between scientific communities and

9:28

pseudoscientific ones in a scientific Community results are put to rigorous critical tests a peer review process is

9:36

carried out to uncover any potential flaws in research methodology or argumentation and only then is the paper

9:43

published and its results accepted into the shared body of knowledge for that field of course this is an idealized

9:50

picture there have been plenty of times where this system has failed or been deliberately undermined but it is still

9:56

a general Trend within scientific communities and the History of Science however coer observes very different

10:03

behavior in pseudo Sciences where she sees belief buddies groups of people who

10:09

already basically agree on things but come together to reconfirm and discuss those beliefs again it is not that this

10:16

is always pseudoscientific if I'm organizing a conference on how to conserve wildlife I probably do only

10:22

want to invite people who already agree it is a good idea otherwise we'll just get nothing done it's a presupposition I

10:29

of the conversation taking place but this inevitably comes with drawbacks in

10:34

ensuring the reliability of the ideas and assumptions for the rest of the video I'm going to refer to this sort of

10:41

phenomenon as a closed epistemic group of course epistemic groups can be closed

10:47

to greater or lesser degrees and openness is not inherently a virtue if

10:52

physics conferences started practicing extreme epistemic openness and hosting groups of flat earthers or geoc

10:58

centrists I doubt that would be helpful but I would suggest that there is a golden mean of epistemic openness that

11:05

is appropriate in a given situation A group of casual friends bonded over an idea might want to be quite

11:11

epistemically closed regarding that idea and I don't see anything inherently wrong with that the trouble with

11:16

pseudoscientific communities is that they are too epistemically closed to be making the kind of broad sweeping

11:23

statements about the world that they often do if you think that astrology can predict the future that is an except

11:29

claim with exceptionally wide scope so refusing to allow valid critique of that

11:34

idea sets up a mismatch between the Ambitions of the field and its level of epistemic openness speaking very broadly

11:42

we can think of epistemic openness as the extent to which a community permits honest and open challenge of their ideas

11:49

and epistemic closeness as the opposite of this or as coer might say an epistemically closed group has far more

11:57

belief buddies than critical community ities so we have two angles from which

12:02

to look at this pseudo science question there are the statements and theories of pseudo scientists which tend to violate

12:09

certain scientific Norms like but not limited to falsifiability and the way

12:14

their communities are constructed which lack the kind of critical analysis that would make their claims and statements

12:21

seem plausible neither the content nor the process justifies the confidence

12:26

given to the assertion and to explore the dynamic of epistemically closed groups in more detail I want to move on

12:33

to perhaps the most extreme example of one the cult if you want to help me make

12:39

more videos like this then please consider becoming one of my wonderful supporters on patreon the link is in the

12:44

description two cult and epistemology the word cult has become so

## Cults and Epistemology

12:52

sensationalize that it is almost impossible to talk about them in a serious manner so in this section I want

12:58

you to R away all of the emotional associations that you have with Cults and just think of them as a group with

13:04

most of the following properties one a claim to have esoteric or specialized knowledge ignored by everyone else two

13:12

the veneration of a leader or set of leaders three a disdain of any challenge

13:17

to the group's beliefs or not permitting those challenges and four an exclusive commitment to the group above all other

13:24

social ties these are all taken from Stephanie Alis Baker's work on cults like defining pseudo science defining a

13:31

cult is very difficult and there will be borderline cases and just for the record I've not included all of the criteria

13:37

here but just the ones most relevant for our discussion some of the lists of criteria for identifying a cult span

13:44

multiple Pages it's fairly well known that Cults and pseudoscientific beliefs

13:49

often go hand inand this is because the combination of claiming to have esoteric knowledge and being unable to question

13:56

that knowledge is almost perfect for cre pseudo science Stefan levandowski has

14:02

pointed out that when pseudo science gets a positive reaction from a group other members of that group and anyone

14:08

who observes them become more likely to believe it they take the group consensus as evidence for example apocalyptic

14:15

Cults often rely on pseudoscientific ideas to predict when the end of the world will come and these ideas are not

14:21

revised even when the F date arrives and the world remains spinning The Seekers a

14:27

UFO cult predicted that the world world would end in 1951 when it did not the

14:32

followers of the group did not disband but became even more devoted they developed ad hoc hypotheses to explain

14:39

why nothing happened very much like the pseudo Sciences we looked at in the last section the philosopher Daniel Monroe

14:46

has recently compared cultish belief Dynamics to what he calls fantasies of knowledge he points out that there's a

14:52

real pleasure in believing we have access to some fundamental truth about reality that no one else does it makes

14:59

us feel special and it imbus us with this sense of power it invokes a little

15:04

of what Mera eliad calls sacredness something both extremely important and

15:09

meaningful and yet mostly hidden from human eyes I really relate to this idea

15:15

I do find an intrinsic pleasure in simply learning things and I imagine that that pleasure would be

15:21

significantly heightened if I thought that it was a deep truth that no one other than me and my group had uncovered

15:26

eliad thought this wish was linked with the human desire for power and stability

15:31

to know what we should be doing and how we should Orient Our Lives Perhaps it is no wonder that so many health and

15:38

wellness Trends have proclaimed that they can cure cancer or remove someone's PCOS using simple dietary changes it

15:46

resembles the link that many other Cults have between esoteric knowledge and some nebulous idea of Salvation none of this

15:52

is to say that health and wellness fads are the same thing as Cults I just want to point out the similarities in how

15:58

their claim to knowledge function and thus how they can both be so appealing

16:03

I'm hardly the first to make this comparison the term Wellness cult has almost slipped into mainstream

16:08

vernacular now Monroe argues that many of these cultish beliefs and conspiracy theories initially function as these

16:15

fantasies of knowledge sometimes for desperate people just trying to make sense of their situation again I sort of

16:22

relate to this I've talked on this channel before about suffering from chronic pain and I was very nearly taken

16:28

in by my own fantasies that if I just tried the right Health fad I would immediately be cured alas no luck so far

16:36

Monroe says that once we are unshed in communities of people doing similar fantasizing the endless repetition of

16:43

the same ideas eventually makes them seem real even when they fly in the face of evidence the fantasy becomes a

16:50

genuine illusory belief and the community insulates The Believer from critique by reassuring them that any

16:57

contradictory evidence has been placed there by Bad actors it's an epistemic version of Dungeons and Dragons where

17:03

everyone is a wizard and the game Never Ends by now it should be clear that

17:08

outright Cults are on the extreme end of that epistemic closeness scale I introduced earlier in many traditional

17:15

Cults Believers are encouraged to cut off friends and family who do not join and to preemptively discredit any

17:21

evidence that would contradict the cult's beliefs this is precisely why I think they are so valuable to look at

17:27

for our current goal of uncovering undesirable or misleading epistemic structures in Plato's Republic Socrates

17:35

argues that to investigate what a just man is it is helpful to ask what a just

17:40

City would look like because that would reproduce many of the same properties on a much greater and grander scale making

17:47

them significantly easier to spot likewise looking at Cults can help us

17:52

understand the key qualities of a closed epistemic group how that group remains so closed and how destructive its

17:59

effects can be the factors that keep people in a cult are varied and

18:04

multifaceted but a few Stand Out There is the Charisma of the leader the

18:09

promise of interpersonal fulfillment the Allure of control and knowledge and a source of meaning in one's life then

18:17

when someone is deep in the cult leaving means abandoning all of the social attachments they have formed there and

18:23

also some of their most strongly held beliefs a study by rousel and colleagues found that many cult members remained in

18:30

the cult for long periods even when they wanted to leave because they feared the social repercussions this coheres with

18:37

the earlier observation made by the psychiatrist Mark galanter that many only lose faith in a cult belief system

18:43

when something about the social fabric of the cult breaks down in other words when the systems maintaining epistemic

18:50

closure are no longer airtite he also observed that leaving a cult was often

18:56

accompanied by a bout of depression as a key source of meaning in the former believer's life had now simply vanished

19:04

these same factors can give us an insight into how any group of people can adopt patently false beliefs or pseudo

19:11

science it might be delivered to them by a charismatic figure who had earned their trust the knowledge might promise

19:17

to solve some great problem in their life or just mark them out as one of the special enlightened ones the belief in

19:24

question might provide someone with a purpose either implicitly or explicitly Charles Manson convinced his followers

19:30

that he was a manifestation of Christ giving them an immediate religious purpose to their lives modern day

19:37

Wellness Cults while unlike formalized Cults in many important ways give people

19:42

an implicit Direction in their life to become as well as possible using their

19:47

particular techniques I'm sure many of you can figure out where I'm going with this and I may have even put it in the

19:53

title these methods of creating an epistemically closed group are certainly not limited to pseudo sciences and Cults

20:00

these are just the most recognizable examples of them perhaps more unsettling is how they replicate in less

20:07

caricatured ways in our everyday L and how recent developments in technology

20:13

have facilitated this three influencers and social media

## Influencers and Social Media

20:21

this section is mostly going to be me telling you not to blindly rely on people like me for your information

20:28

which means a fair few of you will end the section going aha but this guy has

20:33

told me to not just rely on him that probably means he is more reliable than most and I do try to be but I would

20:41

still encourage you not to make me or this channel any kind of exception to the rule I still hold that the Dynamics

20:47

at play in much of social media and specifically social media influences can

20:53

encourage unhealthily closed epistemic systems regardless of whether the influencer in question is aiming to do

20:59

so much has been made of the parasocial relationships that emerge between so-called influencers and their

21:05

audiences the idea is that we form one-sided attachments to the people we watch regularly online in itself this

21:11

seems to be a mixed bag parasocial relationships can help to alleviate loneliness but also can become

21:17

inappropriate or explosive funnily enough the day I'm recording this the YouTube channel wise crack released a

21:23

video exploring this very topic so I'll link it in the description but I want to focus mainly on the way an influencer

21:30

can intentionally or inadvertently disrupt the way people form beliefs to make them more epistemically closed than

21:37

they otherwise would be or is perhaps desirable to return to Stephanie Alice Baker in her book with Chris roek

21:44

lifestyle gurus they discuss how authenticity and self-disclosure can be used to build trust with an audience

21:51

this is a pretty intuitive idea friends in the non-digital world often Bond over

21:56

sharing personal anecdotes or confessing vulnerable information to one another but for an influencer this can quickly

22:03

become epistemically disruptive just because an influencer has confessed some

22:09

deep dark secret to you does not mean that you should take their financial advice or treat them as a general

22:14

Authority the danger is that a mixture of self-disclosure and perceived authenticity can subtly replace the need

22:22

to demonstrate actual expertise on an issue additionally unlike expertise this

22:28

nebulous sense of trust or closeness is transferable to any field for example I

22:34

know a fair amount about two things mathematical logic and philosophy not that I would consider myself an expert

22:40

on either of them but if you want to know the latest developments in health or Fitness I am very much not your man

22:47

of course deep down we already know that just because I've read a bit of nature doesn't mean I'm a good source of

22:53

information on other topics but if we just trust someone in this vague unspecified sense it is very easy to

23:01

treat everything they say as definitely reliable until proven otherwise if

23:06

someone truly does have knowledge on something this is all well and good the problem comes when someone sharing their

23:12

private life on Instagram implicitly makes you more likely to trust their advice about medicine or Finance the

23:19

amount of questionable cryptocurrencies being pushed by influencers whose content is not even about these

23:24

Investments is a testament to just how powerful this nebulous trust relationship can truly be now I'm not

23:33

saying that influencers even those you really dislike are cult leaders a cult

23:38

Leader's power and control over their cult is orders of magnitude greater than

23:43

that of a social media influencer over their audience my point is that a similar overreliance on a particular

23:49

perceived Authority for information can emerge often on very Broad and disperate topics without a good epistemic

23:56

justification for doing so while while a cult leader may use their Charisma or some form of social proof as their roots

24:02

to being uncritically believed the influencer can use their perceived authenticity this may not even be

24:09

deliberate I know that when I've watched a channel for a while I start to implicitly trust the presenter more it

24:15

is the effect of this subtle parasocial and it may even just be human nature we

24:21

are social beings and for the vast majority of our history we could not see someone so much and yet have so little

24:29

contact with them in a real physical sense moreover I suspect that this

24:35

parasocial gives the opportunity for followers to develop Fierce loyalties towards the influencer which has the

24:41

potential to quell dissenting views pretty quickly within the space that they dominate to be Frank this is

24:47

basically speculative on my part but it follows naturally from the factors we've already discussed if an influencer has a

24:54

following that largely likes them and they do not Garner hate follows inad dead then the emotional attachment

25:00

formed to that influencer may make people want to defend them from criticism regardless of whether they

25:05

deserve that criticism again I want to clarify that this is just my speculation and my anecdotal observation I've not

25:12

been able to find any peer-reviewed search that examines this question either way but if it is true it is

25:19

another way that social media Dynamics can replicate cult Dynamics in a much less severe form and thus make them more

25:26

epistemically closed as a result result another Hot Topic has been social media

25:31

Echo Chambers the thing is these are quite difficult to study while it's clear that voluntary Echo Chambers can

25:38

emerge online where communities come together and isolate themselves from critique the jury is still out on where

25:44

the algorithms themselves do create Echo Chambers and to what extent this varies between platforms I've left a few

25:50

sources in the description if you want to check them out but for the sake of this video I will limit our discussion

25:56

to these voluntary Echo chamers here we see yet another example of these

26:01

closed epistemic systems manifesting online in the same way that there might be belief buddies in pseudoscience

26:08

conferences or Cults communities congregate around a set of shared beliefs that are then unlikely to meet

26:14

critical challenge again I don't think this is necessarily bad people have always gathered over Mutual beliefs

26:20

values and interests and this seems like more of a continuation of that General Trend or human propensity than a

26:27

radically new phenomena the difference comes in the ability to isolate yourself

26:32

from dissenting opinions whereas in the non-digital world we are often forced to

26:38

encounter people who disagree with us be it at work or school or with relatives in the digital world we can deliberately

26:45

avoid dissenting thought almost entirely or only confront it in caricatured forms

26:50

presented by our own tea while Research into this tendency is in its preliminary stages some mathematical models have

26:57

predicted that this would lead people to developing ever more extreme opinions it is what buun Han calls the death of the

27:04

other he argues that the mere ability to isolate ourselves from those who

27:09

disagree with us or resist us is both tempting and pentious it is tempting

27:15

because encountering disagreement is often unpleasant especially if it is delivered inconsiderately as is often

27:21

the case online but Han also thinks it is pernicious because isolating ourselves from dissenters and desent

27:28

information can have extremely harmful effects both personally and societally

27:34

Han worries that if we can live just swimming in information that agrees with us then the truth can slowly lose its

27:40

pull we will exist in Blissful ignorance of all the ways we're wrong about things

27:46

by the time we're forced to encounter a genuine critique of our position we'll be so confident in our beliefs that it

27:52

will just have little to no effect on us this mirrors the observation we made in section two about how cult members often

28:00

do not lose faith in cult Doctrine before some aspect of the cult social structure shows its flaws again I'm not

28:07

saying that these are Cults just that we should be wary when the same worrying epistemic Dynamic does appear even in

28:14

less extreme forms lastly there has been a lot of encouraging Research into the

28:20

ways online communities can foster a sense of belonging especially in people who would otherwise be totally socially

28:27

isolated this this is undeniably a great thing and yet like any sense of

28:32

belonging it's worth being aware of how this can also create undesirably

28:37

epistemically closed communities some recent Studies by Max Lebron Christine mcky and others have theorized that

28:45

online conspiracy groups are often motivated by the same sense of social belonging that pseudo Sciences or Cults

28:51

are then the sense that they are on the same team and that they are part of a wider tribe or movement help to insulate

28:58

them from valid critique in meshing them in a web of further belief buddies it's

29:04

not that there is no disagreement within the group on details but rather that the core tenants of the conspiracy just

29:11

can't be questioned if a sense of belonging can disrupt reliable belief formation in major ways in online

29:17

conspiracy groups and Cults it may do so in minor ways in less extreme online

29:23

groups this is definitely speculative but it would be consistent with Solomon Ash's replicated findings that our

29:29

judgments are highly influenced by the judgments of those around us and by extension are probably highly influenced

29:36

by our Social Circle just to reiterate influencers are not cult leaders and

29:41

social media communities are not Cults but many of the same factors that cause people to believe in absurdities in cult

29:49

situations or in pseudo Sciences seem to manifest to a lesser extent Within These social media spaces and in an

29:56

increasingly digital age this is worth knowing about reflecting upon and is also certainly worth some more Empirical

30:03

research conducted by people far more qualified than I am but why am I talking about this why should we care about all

30:10

of these structures that can disrupt belief formation well it's because I

30:15

think we can do something about it four

## Knowledge, Truth, and Communities

30:21

knowledge truth and communities one of the most difficult

30:26

truths to swallow is just how wrong we humans can be about almost everything

30:32

this was succinctly put by Socrates when he was defending himself from prosecution and uttered the famous

30:37

phrase I was conscious that I knew nothing which is sometimes reported as I

30:43

know that I know nothing this saying comes from Plato's apologia and Socrates

30:48

uses it to motivate his curiosity into unfettered and unbridled inquiry he

30:53

narrates how this awareness of his own ignorance caused him to consult poets Craftsmen and anyone he came across to

31:01

learn what wisdom was as a result he does not claim to be wiser than others

31:07

because he knows more than them but rather because he is aware of just how much he does not know so while he may

31:13

not have all that much knowledge neither does he have the illusion of knowledge

31:18

this self-awareness and epistemic humility is what Socrates thought set him apart from many other thinkers of

31:24

the day and it's supposedly why the Oracle of Deli thought that there was no one wiser than he now you can dispute

31:31

whether the Socrates of Plato's dialogues lives up to this ideal but I still think it is an ideal worth

31:38

learning from effectively this video aims to make you aware of just some of

31:44

the structures that can implicitly affect the way that you form beliefs and how more obviously harmful Dynamics from

31:51

pseudo signs or Cults can manifest in less Extreme Ways in online spaces and

31:56

indeed in your everyday life but there is a pessimistic Temptation here to

32:02

throw up our hands and Proclaim that there is no hope that if these distorting mechanisms are basically

32:08

everywhere and affect basically everyone then we are forever cut off from truth

32:13

or honest inquiry however I would caution against this just as communities

32:20

can become epistemically closed they can also open up again it will almost certainly take a lot of effort but we

32:27

can work to Awards building more critical communities both online and

32:32

offline I want to return to Netta CO's paper on pseudoscientific groups because

32:37

alongside the more depressing analysis of their inner workings she notes several aspects of genuine investigative

32:44

inquiry that we can all learn from the first is the strict scrutiny given to

32:50

new ideas and the ability to revise old ones in line with new evidence this

32:55

helps to ensure that any proposed Theory iies are given the appropriate level of consideration at first they are merely

33:02

conjectures or hypotheses and then they are preliminary results and then if the

33:07

results are robust reliable and replicable then the theory is accepted as fact all while acknowledging that

33:14

some new evidence could emerge that would overturn the theory in the future there are a set of values that are held

33:21

as standards for proposed propositions including Precision logical consistency

33:26

and validity of argument there are investigative ideals like the free exchange of ideas that hypotheses should

33:34

not be unduly politically motivated and that results should not be prejudged based on the personal characteristics of

33:40

the researcher cerge is not suggesting that these Norms are all followed at all times there are many examples from The

33:47

History of Science where one or more of them have been violated to severe degrees but this does not invalidate

33:53

them as epistemic ideals to strive for and to guide us so combining this with

34:00

the factors that lead to epistemically closed spaces we now have a sketch criteria for examining the communities

34:07

we are a part of both off and online here are some questions that I would

34:12

suggest are helpful to ask what are the criteria for something being accepted as

34:17

knowledge in this group which statements receive less scrutiny than others and is this lack of scrutiny Justified what are

34:25

the social consequences for holding a desent ing opinion and how do people justify them are propositions revised in

34:32

the light of new evidence or do they persist far beyond that point are there a few figures that the group considers

34:39

reliable by default and why are they considered reliable and finally what

34:45

questions are off limits and are there good reasons for them to be off limits

34:50

this list is certainly not exhaustive and I'm sure you can come up with your own questions as well and I do encourage

34:57

you to leave them in the comments the point is not that epistemic closeness is undesirable but rather the reasons why

35:04

it is closed to certain things and certain ideas is important a biology conference might not want to revisit

35:11

creationism for pretty good reason it is already been considered thoroughly and rejected on epistemically Justified

35:17

grounds on the other hand if a community simply rejects an idea because it is

35:23

oppositional as if that is bad in and of itself then that may be a Cause for alarm I suspect it's probably impossible

35:30

to define a perfect way of working out the epistemic health of the communities we're a part of but using the principles

35:36

in this video I think we can begin to uncover some of the issues that might have passed us by unnoticed we may

35:43

realize that we actually do value the opinions of a few sources much more highly than we can justify or that our

35:50

communities are unjustly intolerant of descent the reason I framed this whole

35:55

discussion at the community level is that there's just far too much information around nowadays to sit

36:01

through it ourselves none of us have the relevant expertise to examine the latest thinking in physics and biology and

36:09

sociology and politics and philosophy and literature and psychology and so on

36:15

so our next best bet is to maximize the collective reliability of the communities we are a part of the

36:21

difference between an epistemically healthy community and an unhealthy one is the difference between astrology and

36:28

general relativity between Alchemy and modern chemistry and between a society

36:33

that stays in touch with the truth and one that loses its way to again draw

36:39

from no urge it is not enough to dismiss pseudo scientists or cultists as fools

36:46

some extremely clever people have fallen into one or both of these camps I think

36:52

it is more fruitful to look at how these unreliable beliefs are proposed and maintained despite consistent evidence

36:59

to the contrary and to avoid these social structures both in our own lives

37:04

and in our societies but if you want to learn more about how to examine your own

37:09

beliefs and learn socrates's own questioning model I have a video on that topic right here thank you so much for

37:17

watching and have a wonderful day
