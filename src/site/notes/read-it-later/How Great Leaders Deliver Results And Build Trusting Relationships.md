There is one universal challenge that every leader must overcome if they are to be successful. Great leaders must have a laser-like focus on delivering their organization’s most important results. At the same time, they must build trust, increase their influence, and motivate others.

James Zenger published the results of a fascinating survey that supports the notion that leaders need to deliver results and build trusting relationships. Zenger’s research focused on what drives employee perceptions of whether the boss is a great leader or not. Below are some of the results.

- Results-oriented leaders are rated as good leaders 14% of the time
- People-oriented leaders are rated as good leaders 12% of the time
- Leaders with both strong results orientation and social skills are rated as good leaders 72% of the time

The combination of being effective at achieving results and building relationships seems to be the secret sauce of leadership success. 

## 5 Ways Leaders Deliver Results And Build Relationships

## 1) Deliver Results

I often see articles and posts that focus solely on the relational aspects of leadership effectiveness (kindness, empathy, listening, understanding, etc.) but does not give equal weight to the importance of delivering results. For an employee to truly put their trust in a leader, they must believe the leader can get the job done while maintaining trusting relationships. 

Leaders must demonstrate expertise and judgment. Employees are more likely to trust a leader when they know the leader has the technical know-how and the experience to make good decisions and provide direction. 

## 2) Service Orientation

Leaders who understand that leading others is a privilege understand that leading, first and foremost, is about service. A leaders’ service orientation refers to whether they focus primarily on their own needs or their focus tends to be on the needs of others or the group.

Do the people you lead believe you understand and have their best interests at heart, or do they feel you are trying to leverage the situation for selfish gain? Below are some ways that leaders can create a service orientation towards those they lead.

- Live the Values Every Day
- Share the Credit
- Delegate Authority
- Coach Others for Success
- Frequently Ask Others for Feedback

## 3) Address Bad Behaviors

The more valuable an employee’s work is to the organization, the more likely a leader will overlook their questionable behavior. If a leader does not take a stand when a high-performer treats others poorly or acts in ways that do not align with the values, the leader sends the message that results are more important than people and culture. The Harvard Business Review shares the following [research](https://hbr.org/2009/04/how-toxic-colleagues-corrode-performance "https://hbr.org/2009/04/how-toxic-colleagues-corrode-performance") about the impact tolerating toxic employees has on other team members' performance.

- 78 percent said their commitment to the organization declined
- 66 percent said their performance declined
- 63 percent lost work time in avoiding the offender
- 48 percent decreased their work effort

## 4) Encourage Healthy Challenge Of Perspectives

I can usually get a quick read on the overall health of a team's relationship with their leader by observing if team members openly share different opinions or appropriately challenge the leader’s perspectives. If team members feel safe in challenging the leader’s perspective, it is a good indication that there is a high degree of trust and respect for all opinions regardless of title. This environment demonstrates that the leader has created a culture where team members can challenge perspectives and share different ideas when searching for the best solution.

## 5) Build A Successful Foundation

It is well-researched and documented that a leader must establish meaningful goals and role clarity to support team performance, strong relationships, and engagement. Without a solid team foundation, trust and performance will always be an issue.

### Goals

Goals provide direction to a team, allowing them to understand where they are now, where they want to go, and unites each person's effort in getting there. Common goals are what make a team a team.

### Roles

Clear and synergistic roles and responsibilities are essential for team success. Everyone should have a clear picture of who is responsible for what and how people must work together to accomplish shared goals. 

Every leadership interaction does not allow for an equal balance of both result and relationship behaviors. Great leaders know how to regulate when they need to be results-oriented and people-oriented based on the unique needs of the situation. Every leader will be judged over time by how effectively they deliver results while creating an inclusive, trusting, and engaging work environment.
