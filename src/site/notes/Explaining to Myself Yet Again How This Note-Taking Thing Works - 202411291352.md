# Explaining to Myself Yet Again How This Note-Taking Thing Works

## Preamble

Man, it's gotta be close to almost 3 years as I've worked inside of Obsidian as my primary organizing mechanism for tasks, journaling, knowledge exploration and management, read it later, references, travel planning, and projects. It's been an adventure honestly. My earliest journal shows 2022-04-14 which sounds about right.

I get asked a lot at work and otherwise to talk to the specifics of how I use this dang thing and stay organized. The glib answer is that in some capacity, I don't, but I've accepted that as a reality that as I change, how I interact with my notes and system is going to change.

Below are going to be a loose set of explanations around rationale, implementation, getting started and frankly other random musings I have on this topic. Maybe this gets posted as one big article, maybe I spread it out, not sure yet, either way, this is mostly for my benefit, but if someone learns something along the way, fantastic.

## How to Not Get Overwhelmed

Without a doubt the thing I see people get wrapped around the axel the most on in this space is 'how'. Stop. No 'how'. 'How' bad. Find 'what' and 'why'.

Have you ever heard of 'products in search of a problem?' That's what you're doing if you start with 'how'. Often this shows up when we get excited about a new technology like Obsidian.md. All I'm saying is be mindful of the [Gartner hype cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle) when you realize Obsidian isn't fixing the things you want it to. That's OK, it's a tool. There are many tools to solve many problems. I've just chosen Obsidian.md again and again for various problems for better or for worse.

### Find a Singular Purpose First

Lets make sure we identify a singular problem we're trying to solve, and attempt to solve it first.

Two basic questions should be answered:

- What are we trying to achieve?
- Why are we trying to achieve it?

A daily journal? Cool. Task management? Also cool. Travel planning? Neat. Please pick one thing though to focus on. Do not get distracted with all the things you could potentially solve. If you do this, you are no longer trying to solve the problem in front of you.

Building a process is a fundamentally different problem than working in a process. One may cause you to think about the other by way of 'it would be nice if I could count the number of times I eat spaghetti in a month', which is great, but write it to the side, and keep on task. When you are ready to spend time working on your process.

As an aside I don't make a strong distinction between process and system, read them interchangeably.

### Do the Thing

Once you've settled on what you're trying to solve and why, then start to do. Just do the thing. Don't overthink it. Create a journal note. Plan that trip. Save those article snippets. Whatever. Value the outcome first and foremost. As you're working, have a side note to start jotting down anything that comes to mind process wise. Mine is just my daily journal which is where I dump fleeting ideas. I have it on a hotkey so no searching necessary. Mainly focus on what's taking time away from the work you want to accomplish. Look for repetition in your work.

Nice. You did the thing. I can make a prediction. It's ugly. Everything feels bespoke and doesn't feel like a system. You wish it was easier.

The great thing here is that now you have data. You know what did and didn't work for you, and now we can work on the process and system side.

### Work on Your Process By Running an Experiment

There really isn't a ton to write here, other than based on your notes earlier during the work you accomplished, set aside time to actually work on the process. Treat the things you wrote down as experiments. Try a few. Then the next time you end up doing your work see if it helped.

This might be researching and installing a plugin. Singular, not plural, remember when I said experiment? Experiments require constants to determine the impact and effect of the change. Leave everything else alone bozo.

What about all those notes you already created that don't have your changes? Up to you honestly. Let's just say I have an inhuman number of notes now, and there are certain experiments where it's worth my time to go back and modify the existing notes, and there are others that are not. That's up to you sport. It helps to have some programming chops, but I'm not going to expect everyone who reads this to have those.

### Repeat

That's, basically it. If you're familiar with software development at all, you'll recognize this cycle in a number of the methodologies we leverage to produce value.

- Find a singular purpose
- Do the thing
- Work on your process by running an experiment
- Repeat

## But For Real, Get Some Basic Templates

I'm going to try and not be too prescriptive across this set of writings, except for this:

Learn 'Templates' plugin or go big and upgrade to [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater). This is going to multiply your consistency across notes one hundred-fold Just do it.

I can make my templater templates available, just ask, just recognize they may only work like 60% in total since they have certain expectations to my vault.

You frankly don't even need to learn that much if you're not up for learning programming. Just go ask ChatGPT and that tends to get you there for basic queries. Otherwise hit up the Obsidian.md discord, lots of friendly people there.

## How I Discover Notes

Let's say you've developed a number of different types of notes on underwater basket weaving and 20th century battle re-enactments, but now you need to actually find something. For me, it always starts with some nagging feeling that I have something captured about the subject at hand, maybe in a conversation or otherwise, and trying to draw it back up can be difficult. It's not a very good system if you can't find what you're looking for.

### You Write for Recall

The most important thing for notes is recall. You know you can't keep everything in your head, that's why you take notes. If the most important property of a note is its ability to be recalled, then the single most important thing that we can build into a note is its ability to be recalled.

There are a bunch of ways to do this in Obsidian.md:

- Search
- Tags
- Links
- Scrolling Through the Files tab like a barbarian (Folders)

I don't care how you choose to organize for recall, but that should be your goal. When you finish a particular note, your last thoughts should be 'how am I going to find this dang thing again later and what do I need to change to make that happen?'

### Building the Context

I personally like to think about this via the [[permanent/LATCH - 202304281226\|LATCH]] method.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/permanent/latch-202304281226/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

<div class="markdown-embed-title">

# LATCH

</div>




# Content

A way of organizing information. LATCH stands for:

- Location
- Alphabet
- Time
- Category
- Hierarchy

# References

[[notes/Emergent note taking what ants can teach us about notes\|Emergent note taking what ants can teach us about notes]] 

[[reference/Information Anxiety - Richard Saul Wurman\|Information Anxiety]]


</div></div>


Anchoring your notes with these qualities gives you a much better opportunity of finding it again in the future. Specifically for Hierarchy and Category, I use something close to the [[permanent/Idea Compass - 202306081233\|Idea Compass]].


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/permanent/idea-compass-202306081233/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

# Idea Compass

</div>




# Content

The idea compass consist of prompts to help you think about how different ideas or concepts may relate to one another.

## North (Upstream)

- Where does this note come from?  
- What are its origins?  
- What belief does X support?  
- What is the higher level domain (zoom out)?  
- What gave birth to X?  
- What causes X?

## South (Downstream)

- Where can X lead to?  
- What does it contribute to?  
- What group/category could x be the headline of?  
- What is a lower level domain (zoom in)?  
- What does X nurture?

## West (Reinforcing)

- What is X similar to?  
- What other disciplines could it already exist in?  
- What other disciplines could benefit from X?  
- What are other ways to say/do X?

## East (Transformative)

- What competes with X?  
- What is the opposite of X?  
- What is X missing?  
- What is a disadvantage with X?  
- What could supercharge X?

### A Contextualized Example

I primarily use note properties in Obsidian.md to help build my ability to recall and rediscover notes. You're going to see a bunch of properties where you might go 'but Ben, that's going to take forever to fill everything in!'. Yes. It would. I get some help from a few plugins and I use templates to speed this along. Did you learn templates yet?

[[permanent/What is a Structural vs Nominal Type System - 202307311546\|Example]]:

![Explaining to Myself Yet Again How This Note-Taking Thing Works - 202411291352-20241129170120525.webp](/img/user/assets/Explaining%20to%20Myself%20Yet%20Again%20How%20This%20Note-Taking%20Thing%20Works%20-%20202411291352-20241129170120525.webp)

Before you ask, yes, I have notes that are specifically about questions I find interesting and would like to get back to and explore some day.

Properties I think that help build context and help recall:

- Create Date
- Modified Dates
- Prompted-By
- Referenced-In
- Related
- Parent
- Tags
- Challenges

So if I come across another conversation where we're talking about type systems, what they are, how they're used, etc. and I need to go dig out my notes on the subject, it's very possible that the things I remember are specifically my colleague and friend Michael Perry prompting the question for me, or maybe just the subject Type System, or maybe in the context of TypeScript, or maybe it was just earlier this week and I can go dig backwards through the dates and find this note (or the note that explains the answer to the question).

You get the idea. Remember, you're leaving breadcrumbs to find your way back to previous context that you found valuable.
